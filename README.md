Code for the ACL 2014 handbook.

ACL 2014 had five parallel sessions. This should be useful for any handbook 
where parallel sessions are listed one per page. 

Directories:

- `input/`: fixed inputs
   - `input/conferences.txt`: list of conferences

- `data/`: where the ACLPUB tarballs are downloaded and unpacked to

- `templates/`: template files used to seed the handbook

- `scripts/`: scripts used to generate the handbook sections from the ACLPUB
  proceedings.

- `content/`: handbook tex files

TODO

- Make sure biblatex-biber is installed

- Generate schedules and metadata for each workshop

- Fill in the tutorials manually, editing
  content/sunday/tutorials-001.tex and so on
