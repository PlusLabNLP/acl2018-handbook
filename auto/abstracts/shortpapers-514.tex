Transfer learning method has been used in opinion analysis to make use of available language resources for other resource-poor languages. However, the cumulative class noise in transfer learning can adversely affect performance when more training data is used. In this paper, we propose a novel method in transductive transfer learning to identify noises through the detection of negative transfers. Evaluation on NLP\&CC 2013 cross-lingual opinion analysis dataset shows that our approach outperformed the state-of-the-art systems. More signifi-cantly, our system shows a monotonic increase trend in performance improvement when more training data are used.
