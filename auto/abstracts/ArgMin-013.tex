Subject of the paper is a new methodological approach for the analysis of public discourses aiming at the semi-automated identification of arguments. Up to now, only little research deals with the automation of manual discourse-linguistic argumentation analysis in German corpora. Therefore, we suggest the combination of methods from discourse analysis with methods from Natural Language Processing such as multi-level annotation. The presented approach is intended to be a first at-tempt to argumentation mining.
