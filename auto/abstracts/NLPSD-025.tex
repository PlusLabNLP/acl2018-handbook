Do rewards from retailers such as free products and recognition in the form of status badges1 influence the recipient's behavior? We present a novel application of natural language processing to detect differences in consumer behavior due to such rewards. Specifically, we investigate the ``Enrollment'' effect, i.e. whether receiving products for free affect how consumer reviews are written. Using data from Amazon's Vine program, we conduct a detailed analysis to detect stylistic differences in product reviews written by reviewers before and after enrollment in the Vine program. Our analysis suggests that the ``Enrollment'' effect exists. Further, we are able to characterize the effect on syntactic and semantic dimensions. This work has implications for researchers, firms and consumer advocates studying the influence of user-generated content as these changes in style could potentially influence consumer decisions.
