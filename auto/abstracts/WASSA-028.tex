Past work on emotion processing has focused solely on detecting emotions, and ignored questions such as `who is feeling the emotion (the experiencer)?' and`towards whom is the emotion directed (the stimulus)?'.  We automatically compile a large dataset of tweets pertaining to the 2012 US presidential elections, and annotate it not only for emotion but also for the experiencer and the stimulus. We then develop a classifier for detecting emotion that obtains an F-score of 55.86 on a 7-way classification task. Finally, we show how the stimulus identification task can also be framed as a classification task, obtaining an F-score of 58.30.ompetitive baselines and obtains an F-score of 58.30.
