In this paper, we first develop the linguistic characteristics of requirements which are specific forms of arguments. The discourse structures that further refine or elaborate requirements are also analyzed. These specific discourse relations are conceptually characterized, with the functions they play. An implementation is carried out in Dislog on the TextCoop platform. Dislog allows high level specifications in logic that allow fast and easy prototyping at a high level of linguistic adequacy. Elements of an indicative evaluation are provided.
