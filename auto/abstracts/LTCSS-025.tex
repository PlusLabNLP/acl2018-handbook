We describe a research activity carried out during January--April 2014, seeking to increase engagement between the natural language processing research community and scholars of communication and the social sciences.  In this activity, participants were offered a corpus of text relevant to the 2007--8 financial crisis and an open-ended prompt.  Their responses took the form of a short paper and an optional demonstration, to which a panel of judges will respond with the goal of identifying efforts with the greatest potential for future interdisciplinary collaboration.
