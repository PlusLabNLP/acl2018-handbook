This paper presents the participation of the Charles University team in the WMT 2014 Medical Translation Task. Our systems are developed within the Khresmoi project, a large integrated project aiming to deliver a multi-lingual multi-modal search and access system for biomedical information and documents. Being involved in organization of this task, our primarily goal is to set up a baseline for both the subtask and all translation directions. Our systems are based on the phrase-based Moses system and standard methods for domain adaptation. The constrained/unconstrained systems differ in the training data only.
