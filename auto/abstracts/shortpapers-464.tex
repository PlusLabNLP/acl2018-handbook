Authorship attribution (AA) aims to identify the authors of a set of documents. Traditional studies in this area often assume that there are a large set of labeled documents available for training. However, in the real life, it is often difficult or expensive to collect a large set of labeled data. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification. In this paper, we present a novel three-view tri-training method to iteratively identify authors of unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each docu-ment in three distinct views, and then perform tri-training to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents. Starting from 10 train-ing documents per author, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed tri-training method for AA. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised method CNG+SVM and other baselines.
