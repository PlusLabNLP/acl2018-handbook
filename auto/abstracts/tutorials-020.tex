We propose a cutting-edge tutorial that investigates the issues of transparency and interpretability as they relate to NLP. Both the research community and industry have been developing new techniques to render black-box NLP models more transparent and interpretable. Reporting from an interdisciplinary team of social science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and NLP researchers, our tutorial has two components: an introduction to explainable AI (XAI) and a review of the state-of-the-art for explainability research in NLP; and findings from a qualitative interview study of individuals working on real-world NLP projects at a large, multinational technology and consulting corporation. The first component will introduce core concepts related to explainability in NLP. Then, we will discuss explainability for NLP tasks and report on a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art literature in AI, NLP, and HCI conferences. The second component reports on our qualitative interview study which identifies practical challenges and concerns that arise in real-world development projects which include NLP.
