This paper describes the joined submission of LIMSI and KIT to the Shared Translation Task for the German-to-English direction.  The system consists of a phrase-based translation system using a pre-reordering approach. The baseline system already includes several models like conventional language models on different word factors and a discriminative word lexicon. This system is used to generate a k-best list. In a second step, the list is reranked using SOUL language and translation models. Originally, SOUL translation models were applied to n-gram-based translation systems that use tuples as translation units instead of phrase pairs. In this article, we describe their integration into the KIT phrase-based system. Experimental results show that their use can yield significant improvements in terms of BLEU score.
