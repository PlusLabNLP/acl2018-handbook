This paper describes the Yandex School of Data Analysis Russian-English system submitted to the ACL 2014 Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation shared translation task. We start with the system that we developed last year and investigate a few methods that were successful at the previous translation task including the new reparameterization of IBM Model 2, unpruned language model and operation sequence model. Next we propose a {simple yet practical} algorithm to transform Russian sentence into a more easily translatable form before decoding. The algorithm is based on the linguistic intuition of Russian-English bilinguals.
