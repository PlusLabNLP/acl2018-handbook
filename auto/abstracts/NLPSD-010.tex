Forums have become major places for online communications for many years, where people often share and express opinion. We observe that, when editing posts, people would whether seriously show their opinions or play jokes and write meaningless post on the discussed topics. We design a unified probabilistic graphical model to capture both topic-driven words and style-driven words. The model can help us separate serious and unserious posts and users. An extensive set of experiments prove the effectiveness of our model.
