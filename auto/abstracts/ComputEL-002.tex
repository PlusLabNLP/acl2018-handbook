In this paper we present the work done in our team for building two Somali language corpora. Firstly a read-speech corpus named Asaas containing about 10 hours and 26 minutes of speech manually transcribed with a well-balanced phonetic distribution is presented. Secondly we describe the collection of a Web-based Somali textual corpus named WARGEYS and containing about 3 million of words and more than 120 000 different words. This corpus is formatted and the spelling fluctuation is standardized.
