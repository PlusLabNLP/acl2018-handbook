We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared task in machine translation. We participated in two language pairs, German-English and Hindi-English. Our particular innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree translation, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create ``synthetic translation options'' that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the parallel training data, and a method of combining the output of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.
