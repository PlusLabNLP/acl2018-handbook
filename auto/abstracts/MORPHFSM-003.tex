Having a morphological analyzer is a very critical issue especially for NLP related tasks on agglutinative languages. This paper presents a detailed computational analysis of Kazakh language which is an agglutinative language. With a detailed analysis of Kazakh language morphology, the formalization of rules over all morphotactics of Kazakh language is worked out and a rule-based morphological analyzer is developed for Kazakh language. The morphological analyzer is constructed using two-level morphology approach with Xerox finite state tools and some implementation details of rule-based morphological analyzer have been presented in this paper.
