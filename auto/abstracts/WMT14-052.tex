We present an effective technique to easily augment GHKM-style syntax-based machine translation systems with phrase pairs that do not comply with any syntactic well-formedness constraints. Non-syntactic phrase pairs are distinguished from syntactic ones in order to avoid harming effects. We apply our technique in state-of-the-art string-to-tree and tree-to-string setups. For tree-to-string translation, we furthermore investigate novel approaches for translating with source-syntax GHKM rules in association with input tree constraints and input tree features.
