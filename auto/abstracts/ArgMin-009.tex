In this paper we proposed a survey in sentiment, polarity and function analysis of citations. This is an interesting area that has had an increased development in recent years but still has plenty of room for growth and further research. The amount of scientific information in the web makes it necessary innovate the analysis of the influence of the work of peers and leaders in the scientific community. We present an overview of general concepts, review contributions to the solution of related problems such as context identification, function and polarity classification, identify some trends and suggest possible future research directions.
