This paper describes the IPN-UPV participation on the English-to-Hindi translation task from WMT 2014 International Evaluation Campaign. The system presented is based on Moses and enhanced with deep learning by means of a source-context feature function. This feature depends on the input sentence to translate, which makes it more challenging to adapt it into the Moses framework. This work reports the experimental details of the system putting special emphasis on: how the feature function is integrated in Moses and how the deep learning representations are trained and used.
