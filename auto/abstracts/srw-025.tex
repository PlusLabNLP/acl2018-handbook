The current work adapts the optimal tree pruning algorithm introduced by Breiman et al. and extended by Chou et al. to the multi-document summarization task.  The tree designed by Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm is successively pruned with the optimal tree pruning algorithm and the sentences assigned to the leaves of the resultant pruned tree are included in the summary.
