This paper describes the University of Edinburgh's neural machine translation systems submitted to the IWSLT 2020 open domain Japanese\$\leftrightarrow\$Chinese translation task. On top of commonplace techniques like tokenisation and corpus cleaning, we explore character mapping and unsupervised decoding-time adaptation. Our techniques focus on leveraging the provided data, and we show the positive impact of each technique through the gradual improvement of BLEU.
