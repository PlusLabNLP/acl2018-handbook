Sentiment-oriented multi-relation extraction from user-generated web documents is of great importance for both producers and consumers. Unlike the previous work, we formulate this extraction task as a learning problem with structured outputs and design the corresponding inference as an integer linear program.  Our newly proposed model based on latent structural SVM can learn from the training corpora, which does not contain explicit annotations of sentiment-bearing expressions, and it can simultaneously recognize both binary (opinion) and ternary (comparison) relations with regard to entity mentions of interest. The empirical evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across domains (camera and movie) and across genres (reviews and forum posts). The gold standard corpus will also be a valuable resource for the community.
