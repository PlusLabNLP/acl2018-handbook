This paper describes Dublin City University's (DCU) submission to the WMT 2014 Medical Summary task. We report our results on the test data set in the French to English translation direction. We also report statistics collected from the corpora used to train our translation system. We conducted our experiment on the Moses 1.0 phrase-based translation system framework. We performed a variety of experiments on translation models, reordering models, operation sequence model and language model. We also experimented with data selection and removal the length constraint for phrase-pair extraction.
