We present a model for generating path-valued interpretations of natural language text. Our model describes a map from natural language descriptions to paths, mediated by segmentation variables which break the language into a discrete set of events, and alignment variables which reorder those events. Within an event, lexical weights capture the contribution of each word to the aligned path segment. We demonstrate the applicability of our model on three diverse tasks: a new color description task, a new financial news task and an established direction-following task. On all three, the model outperforms strong baselines, and on a hard variant of the direction-following task it achieves results close to the state-of-the-art system described in Vogel and Jurafsky (2010).
