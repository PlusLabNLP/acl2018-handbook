We propose an online learning algorithm based on tensor-space models. A tensor-space model represents data in a compact way, and via rank-1 approximation the weight tensor can be made highly structured hence the number of parameters to be estimated is significantly smaller than the traditional vector-space models. This regularizes the model complexity and makes the tensor model highly effective under situations where a large feature set is defined but very low resource is available for training. We experimented the proposed algorithm on a parsing task, and our results show that even with very little training data the learning algorithm based on tensor model performs well, and gives significantly better results than learning algorithms based on traditional vector-space models.
