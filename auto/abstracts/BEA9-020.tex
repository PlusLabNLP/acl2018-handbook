This paper describes an end-to-end prototype system for automated scoring of spoken responses in a novel assessment for teachers of English as a Foreign Language who are not native speakers of English. The 21 speaking items contained in the assessment elicit both restricted and moderately restricted responses, and their aim is to assess the essential speaking skills that English teachers need in order to be effective communicators in their classrooms.  Our system consists of a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognizer; multiple feature generation modules addressing diverse aspects of speaking proficiency, such as fluency, pronunciation, prosody, grammatical accuracy, and content accuracy; a filter that identifies and flags problematic responses; and linear regression models that predict response scores based on subsets of the features. The automated speech scoring system was trained and evaluated on a data set involving about 1,400 test takers, and achieved a speaker-level correlation (when scores for all 21 responses of a speaker are aggregated) with human expert scores of 0.73.
