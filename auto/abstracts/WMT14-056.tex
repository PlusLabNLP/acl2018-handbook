We use parallel FDA5, an efficiently parameterized and optimized implementation of feature decay algorithms for fast deployment of accurate statistical machine translation systems, taking only about half a day for each translation direction. We build Parallel FDA5 Moses SMT systems for all language pairs in the WMT14 translation task and obtain SMT performance close to the top Moses systems with an average of $3.49$ BLEU points difference using significantly less resources for training and development.
