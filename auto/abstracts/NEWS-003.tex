In recent years, the journalists and computer sciences speak to each other to identify useful technologies which would help them in extracting useful information. This is called ``computational Journalism''. In this paper, we present a method that will enable the journalists to  automatically identifies and annotates entities such as names of people, organizations, role and functions of people in legal documents; the relationship between these entities are also explored. The system uses a combination of both statistical and rule based technique. The statistical method used is Conditional Random Fields and for the rule based technique, document and language specific regular expressions are used.
