In this paper we describe experiments on predict HTER, as part of our submission in the Shared Task on Quality  Estimation, in the frame of the 9th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. In our experiment we unsucessfully check whether it is possible to achieve better HTER prediction by training 4 individual regression models for each one of the edit types (deletions, insertions, substitutions, shifts). We also had no improvements when investigating the possibility of adding more data from other minimally post-edited and freely translated datasets.
