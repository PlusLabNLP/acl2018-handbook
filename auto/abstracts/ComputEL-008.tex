This paper examines approaches to generate lexical resources for endangered languages. Our algorithms construct bilingual dictionaries and multilingual thesauruses using public Wordnets and a machine translator. Since our work relies on only one bilingual dictionary between an endangered language and an ``intermediate helper'' language, it is applicable to languages that lack many existing resources.
