Recognizing metaphors and identifying thesource-target mappings is an important taskas metaphorical text poses a big challenge formachine reading. To address this problem, weautomatically acquire a metaphor knowledgebase and an isA knowledge base from billionsof web pages. Using the knowledge bases, wedevelop an inferencing mechanism to recognizeand explain the metaphors in text. Toour knowledge, this is the first purely datadrivenapproach of probabilistic metaphor acquisition,recognition and explanation. Our resultsshow that it is effective and significantlyoutperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
