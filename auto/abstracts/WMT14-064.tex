This paper describes a machine translation metric submitted to the WMT14 Metrics Task. It is a simple modification of the standard BLEU metric using a monolingual alignment of reference and test sentences. The alignment is computed as a minimum weighted maximum bipartite matching of the translated and the reference sentence words with respect to the relative edit distance of the word prefixes and suffixes. The aligned words are included in the $n$-gram precision computation with a penalty proportional to the matching distance. The proposed tBLEU metric is designed to be more tolerant to errors in inflection, which usually does not effect the understandability of a sentence, and therefore be more suitable for measuring quality of translation into morphologically richer languages.
