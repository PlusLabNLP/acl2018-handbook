Facilitating vocabulary knowledge is a challenging aspect for language learners. Although current corpus-based reference tools provide authentic contextual clues, the plain text format is not conducive to fully illustrating some lexical phenomena. Thus, this paper proposes GLANCE , a text visualization tool, to present a large amount of lexical phenomena using charts and graphs, aimed at helping language learners understand a word quickly and intuitively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed interfaces to allow comparison between text and graphics presentation, and conducted a preliminary user study with ESL students. The results show that the visualized display is of greater benefit to the understanding of word characteristics than textual display.
