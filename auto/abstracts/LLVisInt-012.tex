Users with large text collections are often faced with one of two problems; either they wish to retrieve a semantically-relevant subset of data from the collection for further scrutiny (needle-in-a-haystack) or they wish to glean a high-level understanding of how a subset compares to the parent corpus in the context of aforementioned semantic dimensions (forest-for-the-trees).  This paper presents MUCK, an open-source toolkit that addresses both of these problems through a distributed text processing engine with an interactive visualization interface.
