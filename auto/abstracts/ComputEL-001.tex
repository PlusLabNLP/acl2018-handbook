This paper elucidates the InterlinguaPlus design and its application in bi-directional text translations between Ekegusii and Kiswahili languages unlike the traditional translation pairs, one-by-one. Therefore, any of the languages can be the source or target language. The first section is an overview of the project, which is followed by a brief review of Machine Translation. The next section discusses the implementation of the system using Carabao's open machine translation framework and the results obtained. So far, the translation results have been plausible particularly for the resource-scarce local languages and clearly affirm morphological similarities inherent in Bantu languages.
