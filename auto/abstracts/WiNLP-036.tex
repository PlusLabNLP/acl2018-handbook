All over the world and especially Africa, researchers are putting efforts in building Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems to help tackle the language barriers in Africa, a continent of over 2000 different languages. However, the low-resources, diacritical and tonal complexities of African languages are major issues facing African NLP today. The FFR is a major step towards creating a robust translation model from Fon, a very low-resource and tonal language, to French, for research and public use. In this paper, we describe our pilot project: the creation of a large growing corpora for Fon-to-French translations and our FFR v1.0 model, trained on this dataset. The dataset and model are made publicly available to promote collaboration and reproducibility.
