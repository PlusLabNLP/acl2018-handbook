Argumentation mining involves automatically identifying the premises, conclusion, and type of each argument as well as relationships between pairs of arguments in a document. We describe our plan to create a corpus from the biomedical genetics research literature, annotated to support argumentation mining research. We discuss the argumentation elements to be annotated, theoretical challenges, and practical issues in creating such a corpus.
