Research on analyzing reading patterns of dyslectic children has mainly been driven by classifying dyslexia types offline. We contend that a framework to remedy reading errors inline is more far-reaching and will help to further advance our understanding of this impairment. In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive neural model to reinstate migrating words that transpire in letter position dyslexia, a visual analysis deficit to the encoding of character order within a word. Introduced by the anagram matrix representation of an input verse, the novelty of our work lies in the expansion from one to a two dimensional context window for training. This warrants words that only differ in the disposition of letters to remain interpreted semantically similar in the embedding space. Subject to the apparent constraints of the self-attention transformer architecture, our model achieved a unigram BLEU score of 40.6 on our reconstructed dataset of the Shakespeare sonnets.
