Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding projects entities and relations into low dimensional vector space, which has been successfully applied in KG completion task. The previous embedding approaches only model entities and their relations, ignoring a large number of entities' numeric attributes in KGs. In this paper, we propose a new KG embedding model which jointly model entity relations and numeric attributes. Our approach combines an attribute embedding model with a translation-based structure embedding model, which learns the embeddings of entities, relations, and attributes simultaneously. Experiments of link prediction on YAGO and Freebase show that the performance is effectively improved by adding entities' numeric attributes in the embedding model.
