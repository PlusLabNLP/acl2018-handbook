Prof. Charles J. Fillmore had a life-long interest in lexical semantics, and this culminated in the latter part of his life in a major research project, the FrameNet Project at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu).  This paper reports on the background of this ongoing project, its connections to Fillmore's other research interests, and briefly outlines applications and current directions of growth for FrameNet, including FrameNets in languages other than English.
