The wordcloud is a ubiquitous visualization of human language, though it falls short when used for exploratory data analysis. To address some of these shortcomings, we give the viewer explicit control over the creation of the wordcloud, allowing them to interact with it in real time -  a dynamic wordcloud. This allows iterative adaptation of the visualization to the data and inference task at hand. We next present a principled approach to visualization which highlights the similarities and differences between two sets of documents --- a Venncloud. We make all the visualization code (primarily JavaScript) freely available.
