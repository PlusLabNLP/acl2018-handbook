Recently a new kind of top-down parser for Minimalist grammars has been presented in Stabler (2011, 2011). In order to determine these psycholinguistic predictions of the parser, however, a linking hypothesis is needed that connects the behavior of the parser to a processing difficulty metric. Kobele et al. (2012) propose that the difficulty of sentence s correlates with the maximum number of parse steps the parser has to keep a parse item in memory while processing s. This metric is called maximum tenure. In this paper, we show that maximum tenure does not make the right predictions for several phenomena involving relative clauses and left embedding. We present a number of alternative measures and conclude that the best (albeit not perfect) metric is the maximum tenure of pronounced leafs in the parse tree.
