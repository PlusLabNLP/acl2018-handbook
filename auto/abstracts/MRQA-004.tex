Reading Comprehension (RC) of text is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. In recent years, several end-to-end neural network models have been proposed to solve RC tasks. However, most of these models suffer in reasoning over long documents. In this work, we propose a novel Memory Augmented Machine Comprehension Network (MAMCN) to address long-range dependencies present in machine reading comprehension. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate proposed method with the renowned benchmark datasets such as SQuAD, QUASAR-T, and TriviaQA. We achieve the state of the art performance on both the document-level (QUASAR-T, TriviaQA) and paragraph-level (SQuAD) datasets compared to all the previously published approaches.
