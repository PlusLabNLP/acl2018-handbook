Wikipedia contains millions of articles, collaboratively produced. If an article is controversial, an online ``Article for Deletion''(AfD) discussion is held to determine whether the article should be deleted. It is open to any user to participate and make a comment or argue an opinion. Some of these comments and arguments can be counter-arguments, attacks in Dung's (1995) argumentation terminology. Here, we consider the extraction of one type of attack, the directive speech act formed as an imperative.
