Induction of common sense knowledge about prototypical sequence of events has recently received much attention (e.g., Chambers and Jurafsky (2008); Regneri et al. (2010)). Instead of inducing this knowledge in the form of graphs, as in much of the previous work, in our method, distributed representations of event realizations are computed based on distributed representations of predicates and their arguments, and then these representations are used to predict prototypical event orderings. The parameters of the compositional process for computing the event representations and the ranking component of the model are jointly estimated. We show that this approach results in a substantial boost in performance on the event ordering task with respect to the previous approaches, both on natural and crowdsourced texts.
