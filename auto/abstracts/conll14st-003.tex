The paper describes the POSTECH grammatical error correction system. Various methods are proposed to correct errors such as rule-based, probability n-gram vector approaches and router-based approach. Google N-gram count corpus is mainly used for correction resource. Correction candidates are extracted from NUCLE training data and each candidate is evaluated in development data to extract high precision rules and n-gram frames. We achieved an overall F0.5 score of 30.26\%.
