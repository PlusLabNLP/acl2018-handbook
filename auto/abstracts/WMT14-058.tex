We describe Stanford's participation in the French-English and English-German tracks of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT).  Our systems use large feature sets, word classes, and an optional unconstrained language model.  Among constrained systems, ours performed the best according to uncased BLEU: 36.0\% for French-English and 20.9\% for English-German.
