Data-driven approach for parsing may suffer from data sparsity when entirely unsupervised. External knowledge has been shown to effectively help mitigate this problem. Subordinating conjunctions impose important constraints on Chinese syntactic structures. This paper proposes a method to train a grammar with hierarchical subordinating conjunctions category knowledge as explicit annotations. Firstly, each part-of-speech tag of the subordinating conjunctions is annotated with the coarsest category in the hierarchical knowledge. These categories are human-defined to represent distinct syntactic constraints, and provide a good starting point for splitting. Secondly, based on the data-driven state-split approach, we establish a mapping from each automatic refined subcategory to one subcategory in the hierarchical knowledge. Then the data-driven splitting of these categories are restricted by the knowledge to avoid over refinement. Experiments show that constraining the grammar learning by the hierarchical knowledge improves parsing performance significantly on the baseline.
