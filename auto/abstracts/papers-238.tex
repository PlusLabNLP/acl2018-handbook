Extracting opinion targets and opinion words from online reviews are two fundamental tasks in opinion mining. This paper proposes a novel approach to collectively extract them with graph co-ranking. First, compared to previous methods which solely employed opinion relations among words, our method constructs a heterogeneous graph to model two types of relations, including semantic relations and opinion relations. Next, a co-ranking algorithm is proposed to estimate the confidence of each candidate, and the candidates with higher confidence will be extracted as opinion targets/words. In this way, different relations make cooperative effects on confidence estimation of each candidate. Moreover, word preference is captured and incorporated into our co-ranking algorithm. In this way, our co-ranking is personalized and each candidate confidence is only determined by their preferred collocations, which helps to improve the extraction precision. The experimental results on three data sets with different sizes and languages show that our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.
