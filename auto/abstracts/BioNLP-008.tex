This work focuses on signs and symptoms recognition in biomedical texts abstracts. This task is linked to named entity recognition but has been little studied. First, this specific task is described from a linguistic point of view. Then a methodology combining pattern mining and language processing is proposed. In the absence of an authoritative annotated corpus, our approach has the advantage of being weakly-supervised. Preliminary experimental results are discussed and reveal promising avenues.
