This paper describes a system for inter-annotator agreement analysis of ERE annotation, focusing on entity mentions and how the higher-order annotations such as  events are dependent on those entity mentions.  The goal of this approach is to provide both (1) quantitative scores for the various levels of annotation, and (2) information about the types of annotation inconsistencies that might exist. While primarily designed for inter-annotator agreement, it can also be considered a system for evaluation of ERE annotation.
