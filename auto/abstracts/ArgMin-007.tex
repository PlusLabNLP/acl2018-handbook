In the experimental sciences authors use the scientific article to express their findings by making an argumentative claim.  While past studies have located the claim in the Abstract, the Introduction, and in the Discussion section, in this paper we focus on the article title as a potential source of the claim. Our investigation has suggested that titles which contain a tensed verb almost certainly announce the argument claim while titles which do not contain a tensed verb have varied announcements. Another observation that we have confirmed in our dataset is that the frequency of verbs in titles of experimental research articles has increased over time.
