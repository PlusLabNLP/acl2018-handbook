The CoNLL-2014 shared task is an extension of last year's shared task and focuses on correcting grammatical errors in essays written by non-native learners of English.  In this paper, we describe the Illinois-Columbia system that participated in the shared task. The core of the system is based on the University of Illinois model that placed first in the CoNLL-2013 shared task. This baseline model has been improved and expanded for this year's competition in several respects. We describe our underlying approach, which relates to our previous work, and describe the novel aspects of the system in more detail.
