Under the framework of the argumentation scheme theory (Walton, 1996), we developed annotation protocols for an argumentative writing task to support identification and classification of the arguments being made in essays. Each annotation protocol defined argumentation schemes (i.e., reasoning patterns) in a given writing prompt and listed questions to help evaluate an argument based on these schemes, to make the argument structure in a text explicit and classifiable. We report findings based on an annotation of 600 essays. Most annotation categories were applied reliably by human annotators, and some categories significantly contributed to essay score. An NLP system to identify sentences containing scheme-relevant critical questions was developed based on the human annotations.
