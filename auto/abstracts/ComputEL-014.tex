We present a case study of the methodology of using information extracted from interlinear glossed text (IGT) to create of actual working HPSG grammar fragments using the Grammar Matrix focusing on one language: Chintang. Though the results are barely measurable in terms of coverage over running text, they nonetheless provide a proof of concept.  Our experience report reflects on the ways in which this task is non-trivial and on mismatches between the assumptions of the methodology and the realities of IGT as produced in a large-scale field project.
