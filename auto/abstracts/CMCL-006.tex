This paper presents a vectorial incremental parsing model defined using independently posited operations over activation-based working memory and weight-based episodic memory.  This model has the attractive property that it hypothesizes only one unary preterminal rule application and only one binary branching rule application per time step, which allows it to be smoothly integrated into a vector-based recurrence that propagates structural ambiguity from one time step to the next.  Predictions of this model are calculated on a center-embedded sentence processing task and shown to exhibit decreased processing accuracy in center-embedded constructions.
