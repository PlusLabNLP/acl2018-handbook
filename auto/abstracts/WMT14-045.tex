We present a new version of Phrasal, an open-source toolkit for statistical phrase-based machine translation. This revision includes features that support emerging research trends such as (a) tuning with large feature sets, (b) tuning on large datasets like the bitext, and (c) web-based interactive machine translation. A direct comparison with Moses shows favorable results in terms of decoding speed and tuning time.
