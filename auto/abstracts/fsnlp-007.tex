FrameNet is the best currently operational version of Chuck Fillmore's Frame Semantics. As FrameNet has evolved over the years, we have been building a series of increasingly ambitious prototype systems that exploit FrameNet as a semantic resource. Results from this work point to frames as a natural representation for applications that require linking textual meaning to world knowledge.
