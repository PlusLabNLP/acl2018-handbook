In this paper, we present a new fine-grained opinion mining dataset called SentiTel that is human annotated for targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA). SentiTel contains Twitter reviews about three Ugandan telecoms posted in the period between February 2019 and September 2019. The 5\,973 reviews are human annotated with the target entity (target telecom), aspect and opinion polarity towards the aspect. The reviews contain at least one target telecom. Two models are presented on the TABSA task that is the random forest (RF) which is the baseline model and BERT.
