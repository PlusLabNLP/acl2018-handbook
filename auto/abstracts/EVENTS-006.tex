Structured machine-readable representations of news articles can radically change the way we interact with information. One step towards obtaining these representations is event extraction - the identification of event triggers and arguments in text. With previous approaches mainly focusing on classifying events into a small set of predefined types, we analyze unsupervised techniques for complex event extraction. In addition to extracting event mentions in news articles, we aim at obtaining a more general representation by disambiguating to concepts defined in knowledge bases. These concepts are further used as features in a clustering application. Two evaluation settings highlight the advantages and shortcomings of the proposed approach.
