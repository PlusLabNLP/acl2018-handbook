This paper describes LIMSI's submission to the first medical translation task at WMT'14. We report results for English-French on the subtask of sentence translation from summaries of medical articles. Our main submission uses a combination of NCODE (n-gram-based) and MOSES (phrase-based) output and continuous-space language models used in a post-processing step for each system. Other characteristics of our submission include: the use of sampling for building MOSES' phrase table; the implementation of the vector space model proposed by Chen et al. (2013); adaptation of the POS-tagger used by N CODE to the medical domain; and a report of error analysis based on the typology of Vilar et al. (2006).
