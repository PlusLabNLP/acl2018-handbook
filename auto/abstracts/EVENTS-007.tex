A simple conceptual model is employed to investigate events, and break the task of coreference resolution into two steps: semantic class detection and similarity-based matching. With this perspective an algorithm is implemented to cluster event mentions in a large-scale corpus. Results on test data from AQUAINT TimeML, which we annotated manually with coreference links, reveal how semantic conventions vs. information available in the context of event mentions affect decisions in coreference analysis.
