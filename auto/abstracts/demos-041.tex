We present GFL-Web, a web-based interface for syntactic dependency annotation with the lightweight FUDG/GFL formalism. Syntactic attachments are specified in GFL notation and visualized as a graph. A one-day pilot of this workflow with 26 annotators established that even novices were, with a bit of training, able to rapidly annotate the syntax of English Twitter messages.
