Consumers' purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated online re- views. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting deceptive opinion spam fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the readers. In this paper, we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam based on a new gold standard data, which is comprised of data from four different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Airline, Doctor), each of which contains three types of reviews, i.e. costumer generated truthful reviews, Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews and we hope that it would be of help to customers when making purchase decisions, and review portal operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp to investigate fraudulent activity on their sites.
