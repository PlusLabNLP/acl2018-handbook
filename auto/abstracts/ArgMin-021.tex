In online discussions, users often back up their stance with arguments. Their arguments are often vague, implicit, and poorly worded, yet they provide valuable insights into reasons underpinning users' opinions. In this paper, we make a first step towards argument-based opinion mining from on-line discussions and introduce a new task of argument recognition. We match user-created comments to a set of predefined topic-based arguments, which can be either attacked or supported in the comment. We present a manually-annotated corpus for argument recognition in online discussions. We describe a supervised model based on comment-argument similarity and entailment features. Depending on problem formulation, model performance ranges from 70.5\% to 81.8\% F1-score, and decreases only marginally when applied to an unseen topic.
