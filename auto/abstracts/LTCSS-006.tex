Vernacular regions such as central Ohio are popularly used in everyday language; but their vague and indeter-ministic boundaries affect the clarity of communicating them over the geo-graphic space. This paper introduced a context-based natural language pro-cessing approach to retrieve geograph-ic entities. Geographic entities extract-ed from news articles were used as lo-cation-based behavioral samples to map out the vague region of central Ohio. Particularly, part of speech tag-ging and parse tree generation were employed to filter out candidate enti-ties from English sentences. Proposi-tional logic of context (PLC) was in-troduced and adapted to build the con-textual model for deciding the mem-bership of named entities. Results were automatically generated and visualized in GIS using both symbol and density mapping. Final maps were consistent with our intuition and common sense knowledge of the vague region.
