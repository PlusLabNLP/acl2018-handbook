While previous sentiment analysis research has concentrated on the interpretation of explicitly stated opinions and attitudes, this work addresses a type of opinion implicature (i.e., opinion-oriented default inference) in real-world text. This work describes a rule-based conceptual framework for representing and analyzing opinion implicatures. In the course of understanding implicatures, the system recognizes implicit sentiments (and beliefs) toward various events and entities in the sentence, often of mixed polarities; thus, it produces a richer interpretation than is typical in opinion analysis.
