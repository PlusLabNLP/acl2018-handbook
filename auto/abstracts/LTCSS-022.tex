Seeking information online can be an exercise in time wasted wading through repetitive, verbose text with little actual content. Some documents are more densely populated with factoids (fact-like claims) than others. The densest documents are potentially the most efficient use of time, likely to include the most information. Thus some measure of ``factiness'' might be useful to readers. Based on crowdsourced ratings of the factual content of 772 online news articles, we find that after controlling for widely varying document length using Heaps' Law, a significant positive correlation exists between perceived factual content and relative information entropy.
