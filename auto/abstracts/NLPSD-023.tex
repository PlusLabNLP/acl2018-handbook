Detection of fine-grained opinions and beliefs holds promise for improved social media analysis for social science research, business intelligence, and government decision-makers. While commercial applications focus on mapping landscapes of opinions towards brands and products, our goal is to map ``sociostructural'' landscapes of perceptions of social groups. In this work, we focus on the detection of views of social group status differences. We report an analysis of methods for detecting views of the legitimacy of income inequality in the U.S. from online discussions, and demonstrate detection rates competitive with results from similar tasks such as debate stance classification.
