Events are not a discrete linguistic phenomenon. Different verbal and nominal predicates express different degrees of eventiveness. In this paper we analyze the qualities that contribute to the overall eventiveness of a predicate, that is, what makes a predicate an event. We provide an in-depth analysis of seven key qualities, along with experimental assessments demonstrating their contributions. We posit that these qualities are an important part of a functional working definition of events.
