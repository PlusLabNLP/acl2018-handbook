This paper describes our factored statistical machine translation (SMT) system for grammatical error correction by using small-scale training data in the CoNLL 2014 Shared Task. We constructed several systems with various factors compared with phrase-based statistical machine translation. The factors contain not only morphological information such as stem, prefix, suffix, but also syntactic information such as PoS. We tried to easily combine different systems or use the pipeline, although the effects are not so good, it exposed a lot of valuable information.
