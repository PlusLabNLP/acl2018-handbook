Open IE methods extract structured propositions from text. However, these propositions are neither consolidated nor generalized, and querying them may lead to insufficient or redundant information. This work suggests an approach to organize open IE propositions using entailment graphs. The entailment relation unifies equivalent propositions and induces a specific-to-general structure. We create a large dataset of gold-standard proposition entailment graphs, and provide a novel algorithm for automatically constructing them. Our analysis shows that predicate entailment is extremely context-sensitive, and that current lexical-semantic resources do not capture the lexical inferences induced by proposition entailment.
