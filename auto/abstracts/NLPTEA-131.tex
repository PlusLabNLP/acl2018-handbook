The main goal of Chinese grammatical error diagnosis task is to detect word er-rors in the sentences written by Chinese-learning students.  Our previous system would generate error-corrected sentences as candidates and their sentence likeli-hood were measured based on a large scale Chinese n-gram dataset.  This year we further tried to identify long frequent-ly-seen subsentences and label them as correct in order to avoid propose too many error candidates.  Two new methods for suggesting missing and selection er-rors were also tested.
