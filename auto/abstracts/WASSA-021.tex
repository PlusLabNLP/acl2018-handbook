In this paper we investigate the efficiency of the novel term weighting algorithm for opin-ion mining and topic categorization of arti-cles from newspapers and Internet. We com-pare the novel term weighting technique with existing approaches such as TF-IDF and ConfWeight. The performance on the data from the text-mining campaigns DEFT'07 and DEFT'08 shows that the proposed meth-od can compete with existing information re-trieval models in classification quality and that it is computationally faster. The pro-posed text preprocessing method can be ap-plied in large-scale information retrieval and data mining problems and it can be easily transported to different domains and different languages since it does not require any domain-related or linguistic information.
