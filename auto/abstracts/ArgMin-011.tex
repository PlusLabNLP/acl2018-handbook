In this paper we look at the manual analysis of arguments and how this compares to the current state of automatic argument analysis. These considerations are used to develop a new approach combining a machine learning algorithm to extract propositions from text, with a topic model to determine  argument structure.   The  results of this method are compared to a manual analysis carried out on 19th century philosophical texts.
