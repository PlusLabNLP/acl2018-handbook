We describe our systems for the WMT14 Shared Task on Quality Estimation (subtasks 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3). Our submissions use the framework of Multi-task Gaussian Processes, where we combine multiple datasets in a multi-task setting. Due to the large size of our resulting settings we also experiment with Sparse Gaussian Process, which aim to speed up training and prediction by providing sensible sparse approximations.
