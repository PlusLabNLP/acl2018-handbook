We present a new approach to inducing the syntactic categories of words, combining their distributional and morphological properties in a joint nonparametric Bayesian model based on the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process. In this framework, a log-linear model of morphological similarity acts as a prior distribution over word clusterings; the likelihood function is the probability of generating vector word embeddings. The weights of the morphology model are learned jointly while inducing part-of-speech clusters, and are therefore driven to cohere with the distributional features. The resulting algorithm outperforms competitive alternatives on English POS induction.
