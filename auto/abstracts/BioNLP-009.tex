The dual process model (Evans, 2008) posits two types of decision-making, which may be ordered on a continuum from intuitive to analytical (Hammond, 1981). This work uses a dataset of narrated image-based clinical reasoning, collected from physicians as they diagnosed dermatological cases presented as images. Two annotators with training in cognitive psychology assigned each narrative a rating on a four-point decision scale, from intuitive to analytical. This work discusses the annotation study, and makes contributions for resource creation methodology and analysis in the clinical domain.
