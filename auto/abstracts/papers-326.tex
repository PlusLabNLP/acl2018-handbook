Morphological segmentation is an effective sparsity reduction strategy for statistical machine translation (SMT) involving morphologically complex languages. When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best output from the de- coder. In this paper, we expand our translation options by desegmenting n-best lists or lattices. Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm gives us access to both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs. This allows us to include features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM), to help select the best translation. We investigate this technique in the context of English-to-Arabic and English-to-Finnish translation, showing significant improvements over desegmentation of 1-best decoder outputs.
