This paper describes the Dublin City University terminology translation system used for our participation in the query translation subtask in the medical translation task in the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT14).  We deployed six different kinds of terminology extraction methods, and participated in three different tasks: FR--EN and EN--FR query tasks, and the CLIR task.              We obtained 36.2 BLEU points absolute for FR--EN and 28.8 BLEU points absolute for EN--FR tasks where we obtained the first place in both tasks.  We obtained 51.8 BLEU points absolute for the CLIR task.
