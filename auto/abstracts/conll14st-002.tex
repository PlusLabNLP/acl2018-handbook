This paper describes our submission to the CoNLL 2014 shared task on grammatical error correction using an integrated approach, which includes both a rule-based and an SMT system augmented by a large web-based language model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correction type estimation can be used to remove unnecessary corrections, improving precision without harming recall. Our best hybrid system achieves competitive results, ranking <nth> and <nth> on the original and revised test sets respectively.
