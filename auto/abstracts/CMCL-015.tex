We outline four ways in which uncertainty might affect comprehension difficulty in human sentence processing. These four hypotheses motivate a self-paced reading experiment, in which we used verb sub- categorization distributions to manipulate the uncertainty over the next step in the syntactic derivation (single step entropy) and the surprisal of the verb's comple- ment. We additionally estimate word- by-word surprisal and total entropy over parses of the sentence using a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). Surprisal and total entropy, but not single step en- tropy, were significant predictors of read- ing times in different parts of the sen- tence. This suggests that a complete model of sentence processing should incorporate both entropy and surprisal.
