We present a low-resource, language-independent system for text difficulty assessment. We replicate and improve upon a baseline by Shen et al. (2013) for readability assessment on the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale. Our work demonstrates that the addition of morphological, information theoretic, and language modeling features to a traditional readability baseline greatly benefits performance on this scale. We compare two algorithms, the Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm and Support Vector Machines, for our experiments on Arabic, Dari, English, and Pashto and provide a detailed analysis of our results.
