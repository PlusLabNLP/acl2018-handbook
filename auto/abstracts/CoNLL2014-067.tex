In this paper, we address the problem of converting Dialectal Arabic (DA) text that is written in the Latin script (called Arabizi) into Arabic script following the CODA convention for DA orthography. The presented system uses a finite state transducer trained at the character level to generate all possible transliterations for the input Arabizi words. We then filter the generated list using a DA morphological analyzer. After that we pick the best choice for each input word using a language model. We achieve an accuracy of 69.4\% on an unseen test set compared to 63.1\% using a system which represents a previously proposed approach.
