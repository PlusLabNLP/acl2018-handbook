This paper aims to provide an effective interface for progressive refinement of pattern-based information extraction systems. Pattern-based information extraction (IE) systems have an advantage over machine learning based systems that patterns are easy to customize to cope with errors and are interpretable by humans. Building a pattern-based system is usually an iterative process of trying different parameters and thresholds to learn patterns and entities with high precision and recall. Since patterns are interpretable to humans, it is possible to identify sources of errors, such as patterns responsible for extracting incorrect entities and vice-versa, and correct them. However, it involves time consuming manual inspection of the extracted output. We present a light-weight tool, SPIED, to aid IE system developers in learning entities using patterns with bootstrapping, and visualizing the learned entities and patterns with explanations. SPIED is the first publicly available tool to visualize diagnostic information of multiple pattern learning systems to the best of our knowledge.
