We present an incremental dependency parsing model that jointly performsdisfluency detection.  The model handles speech repairs using a novel non-monotonictransition system, and includes several novel classes of features. Together, these additions improve parse accuracy by 1\%.  The model runs in expected linear time, and processes over 700 sentences a second. For comparison, we evaluated two pipeline systems, using state-of-the-art disfluencydetectors.  The joint model performed better on both tasks,with a parse accuracy of 90.5\% and 84.0\% accuracy at disfluency detection.
