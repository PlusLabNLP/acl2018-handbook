Phrase-based translation models usually memorize local translation literally and make independent assumption between phrases which makes it neither generalize well on unseen data nor model sentence-level effects between phrases. In this paper we present a new method to model correlations between phrases into a Markov model and meanwhile employ a robust smoothing strategy to provide better generalization. It defines a recursive estimation process and backs off in parallel to infer richer structures. Our evaluation shows an 1.1--3.2 BLEU improvement over competitive baselines for Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation.
