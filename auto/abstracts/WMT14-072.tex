This paper describes the string-to-tree systems built at the University of Edinburgh for the WMT 2014 shared translation task.  We developed systems for English-German, Czech-English, French-English, German-English, Hindi-English, and Russian-English.  This year we improved our English-German system through target-side compound splitting, morphosyntactic constraints, and refinements to parse tree annotation; we addressed the out-of-vocabulary problem using transliteration for Hindi and Russian and using morphological reduction for Russian; we improved our German-English system through tree binarization; and we reduced system development time by filtering the tuning sets.
