We present our English-Czech and English-Hindi submissions for this year's WMT translation task. For English-Czech, we build upon last year's Chimera and evaluate several setups. English-Hindi is a new language pair for this year. We experimented with reverse self-training to acquire more (synthetic) parallel data and with modeling target-side morphology.
