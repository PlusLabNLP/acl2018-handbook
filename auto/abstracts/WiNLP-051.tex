In this study, we apply NLP methods to learn about the framing of the 2020 Democratic Presidential candidates in news media. We use both a lexicon-based approach and word embeddings to analyze how candidates are discussed in news sources with different political leanings.  Our results show significant differences in the framing of candidates across the news sources along several dimensions, such as sentiment and agency, paving the way for a deeper investigation.
