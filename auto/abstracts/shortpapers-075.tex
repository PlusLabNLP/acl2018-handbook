Internet users are keen on creating different kinds of morphs to avoid censorship, express strong sentiment or humor. For example, in Chinese social media, users often use the entity morph ``XXX (Instant Noodles)'' to refer to ``XXX (Zhou Yongkang)'' because it shares one character ``X (Kang)'' with the well-known brand of instant noodles ``XXX (Master Kang)''. We developed a wide variety of novel approaches to automatically encode proper and interesting morphs, which can effectively pass decoding tests.
