Internet users are keen on creating different kinds of morphs to avoid censorship, express strong sentiment or humor. For example, in Chinese social media, users often use the entity morph ``方便面 (Instant Noodles)'' to refer to ``周永康 (Zhou Yongkang)'' because it shares one character ``康 (Kang)'' with the well-known brand of instant noodles ``康师傅 (Master Kang)''. We developed a wide variety of novel approaches to automatically encode proper and interesting morphs, which can effectively pass decoding tests.
