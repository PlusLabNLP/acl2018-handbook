We present a novel semantic framework for modeling linguistic expressions of generalization---generic, habitual, and episodic statements---as combinations of simple, real-valued referential properties of predicates and their arguments. We use this framework to construct a dataset covering the entirety of the Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank. We use this dataset to probe the efficacy of type-level and token-level information---including hand-engineered features and static (GloVe) and contextual (ELMo) word embeddings---for predicting expressions of generalization.
