This paper describes the system jointly developed by members of the Departament de Llenguatges i Sistemes Inform√†tics at Universitat d'Alacant and the Prompsit Language Engineering company for the shared translation task of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. We present a phrase-based statistical machine translation system whose phrase table is enriched with information obtained from dictionaries and shallow-transfer rules like those used in rule-based machine translation. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the transfer rules used were not written by humans, but automatically inferred from a parallel corpus.
