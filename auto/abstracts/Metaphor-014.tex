This paper presents a metaphor interpretation pipeline based on abductive inference. In this framework following (Hobbs, 1992) metaphor interpretation is modelled as a part of the general discourse processing problem, such that the overall discourse coherence is supported. We present an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using linguistic data in English and Russian.
