Argumentation in a scientific article is composed of unexpressed and explicit statements of old and new knowledge combined into a logically coherent textual argument. Discourse relations, linguistic coherence relations that connect discourse segments, help to communicate an argument's logical steps. A biomedical relation exhibits a relationship between biomedical entities. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the extraction of  connections between biomedical relations, a connection that we call a higher order relation. We combine two methods, namely biomedical relation extraction and discourse relation parsing, to extract such higher order relations from biomedical research articles. Finding and extracting these relations can assist in automatically understanding the scientific arguments expressed by the author in the text.
