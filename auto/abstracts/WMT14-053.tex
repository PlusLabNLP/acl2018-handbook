This paper presents the results of the WMT14 Metrics Shared Task. We asked participants of this task to score the outputs of the MT systems involved in WMT14 Shared Translation Task. We collected scores of 23 metrics from 12 research groups. In addition to that we computed scores of 4 standard metrics such as BLEU, WER, PER as baselines. The collected scores were evaluated in terms of system level correlation (how well each metric's scores correlate with WMT14 official manual ranking of systems) and in terms of segment level correlation (how often a metric agrees with humans in comparing two translations of a particular sentence).
