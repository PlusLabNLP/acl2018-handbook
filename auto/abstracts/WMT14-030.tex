This paper explores a number of simple and effective techniques to adapt statistical machine translation (SMT) systems in the medical domain. Comparative experiments are conducted on large corpora for six language pairs. We not only compare each adapted system with the baseline, but also combine them to further improve the domain-specific systems. Finally, we attend the WMT2014 medical summary sentence translation constrained task and our systems achieve the best BLEU scores for Czech-English, English-German, French-English language pairs and the second best BLEU scores for reminding pairs.
