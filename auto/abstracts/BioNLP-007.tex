We present an active learning method for placing the event mentions in an operative note into a pre-specified event structure.  Event mentions are first classified into action, peripheral action, observation, and report events.  The actions are further classified into their appropriate location within the event structure.  We examine how utilizing active learning significantly reduces the time needed to completely annotate a corpus of 2,820 appendectomy notes.
