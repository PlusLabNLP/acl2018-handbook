This paper presents a proof-of-concept tool for providing automated explicit feedback to language learners based on data mined from Wikipedia revisions. The tool takes a sentence with a grammatical error as input and displays a ranked list of corrections for that error along with evidence to support each correction choice. We use lexical and part-of-speech contexts, as well as query expansion with a thesaurus to automatically match the error with evidence from the Wikipedia revisions. We demonstrate that the tool works well for the task of preposition selection errors, evaluating against a publicly available corpus.
