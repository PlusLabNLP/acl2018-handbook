In this paper we describe the PKU system for the CoNLL-2014 grammar error correction shared task. We propose a unified framework for correcting all types of errors. A language model is used to correct the replacement errors while two extra classification models are trained to correct errors related to determiners and prepositions. Our system achieves 24.19\% in f\_0.5 on the test data.
