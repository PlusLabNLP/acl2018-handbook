This paper describes the statistical machine translation (SMT) systems developed at RWTH Aachen University for the German-to-English translation task of the ACL 2014 Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2014). Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT systems are applied employing hierarchical phrase reordering and word class language models. For the phrase-based system, we run discriminative phrase training. In addition, we describe our preprocessing pipeline for German-to-English.
