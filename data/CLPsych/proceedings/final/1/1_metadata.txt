Abstract#==#The present study aims to investigate the   application of prosodic speech
features in a psychological intervention based on life-review. Several studies
have shown that speech features can be used as indicators of depression
severity, but these studies are mainly based on controlled speech recording
tasks instead of natural conversations. The present exploratory study
investigated speech features as indicators of depression in conversations of a
therapeutic intervention. The changes in the prosodic speech features pitch,
duration of pauses, and total duration of the participantâ€™s speaking time
were studied over four sessions of a life-review inter-vention for three older
participants. The ecological validity of the dynamics observed for prosodic
speech features could not be established in the present study. The changes in
speech features differed from what can be expected in an intervention that is
effective in decreasing depression and were inconsistent with each other for
each of the participants. We suggest future research to investigate changes
within the intervention sessions, to relate the changes in feature values to
the topical content of the speech, and to relate the speech features directly
to depression scores.
