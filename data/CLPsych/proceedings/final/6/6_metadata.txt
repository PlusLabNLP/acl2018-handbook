Abstract#==#Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders(ND) such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related Dementias is currently a challenge. Currently, AD can
only be diagnosed by examining the patient’s brain after death and Dementia
is diagnosed typically through consensus using specific diagnostic criteria
and extensive neuropsychological examinations with tools such as the
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA). In this paper, we use several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to build
diagnostic models using syntactic and lexical features resulting from verbal
utterances of AD and related Dementia patients. We emphasize that the best
diagnostic model distinguished the AD and related Dementias group from the
healthy elderly group with 74% F-Measure using Support Vector Machines(SVM).
Additionally, we perform several statistical tests to indicate the significance
of the selected linguistic features. Our results show that syntactic and
lexical features could be good indicative features for helping to diagnose AD
and
related Dementias.
