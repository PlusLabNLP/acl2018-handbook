Abstract#==#We use computational techniques to extract a large number of different features
from the narrative speech of individuals with primary progressive aphasia
(PPA).
We examine several different types of features, including part-of-speech,
complexity, context-free grammar, fluency, psycholinguistic, vocabulary
richness, and acoustic, and discuss the circumstances under which they can be
extracted. We consider the task of training a machine learning classifier to
determine whether a participant is a control, or has the fluent or nonfluent
variant of PPA.We first evaluate the individual feature sets on their
classification accuracy, then perform an ablation study to determine the
optimal combination of feature sets. Finally, we rank the features in four
practical scenarios: given audio data only, given unsegmented transcripts only,
given segmented transcripts only, and given both audio and segmented
transcripts. We find that psycholinguistic features are highly discriminative
in most cases, and that acoustic, context-free grammar, and part-of-speech
features can also be important in some circumstances.
