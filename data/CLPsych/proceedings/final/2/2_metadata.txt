Abstract#==#Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disorders characterised as deficits
in social and communication skills, and they affect both verbal and non-verbal
communication. Previous works measured differences in children with and without
autism spectrum disorders in terms of linguistic and acoustic features,
although they do not mention automatic identification using integration of
these features. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study of several
language and speech features of both single utterances and full narratives. We
find that there are characteristic differences between children with autism
spectrum disorders and typical development with respect to word categories,
prosody, and voice quality, and that these differences can be used in automatic
classifiers. We also examine the differences between American and Japanese
children and find significant differences with regards to pauses before new
turns and linguistic cues.
