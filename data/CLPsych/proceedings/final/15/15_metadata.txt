Abstract#==#This paper describes the three phases of the Durkheim Project.              For this
project we developed a clinician's dashboard that displays output of models
predicting suicide risk of veterans and active duty military personnel.  
During phase one, we built the clinicianâ€™s dashboard and com-pleted a
Veterans Affairs (VA) predictive risk medical records study, based on an
analysis of the narrative, or free text, portions of VA medical records, In
phase two, we will predict suicide risk based on opt-in social media postings
by patients using social media websites, e.g., Facebook. We describe the
software infrastructure that we have completed for this phase two system. 
During phase three we will provide a three layer intervention strategy.  We
discuss our methodology for the three phases, including IRB-approved protocols
for the first two phases and a soon-to-be approved IRB protocol for phase
three.
