Abstract#==#Depression is typically diagnosed as being present or absent.However,
depression severity is believed to be continuously distributed rather than
dichotomous. Severity may vary for a given patient daily and seasonally as a
function of many variables ranging from life events to environmental factors.
Repeated population-scale assessment of depression through questionnaires is
expensive. In this paper we use survey responses and status updates from 28,749
Facebook users to develop a regression model that predicts users' degree of
depression based on their Facebook status updates. Our user-level predictive
accuracy is modest, significantly outperforming a baseline of average user
sentiment. We use our model to estimate user changes in depression across
seasons, and find, consistent with literature, users' degree of depression most
often increases from summer to winter. We then show the potential to study
factors driving individuals' level of depression by looking at its most highly
correlated language features.
