Abstract#==#SALT is a widely used annotation approach for analyzing natural language
transcripts of children. Nine annotated corpora are distributed along with
scoring software to provide norming data. We explore automatic identification
of mazes –- SALT’s version of disfluency annotations –- and find that
cross-corpus generalization is very poor. This surprising lack of cross- corpus
generalization suggests substantial differences between the corpora. This is
the first paper to investigate the SALT corpora from the lens of natural
language processing, and to compare the utility of different corpora collected
in a clinical setting to train an automatic annotation system.
