Abstract#==#Children with autism spectrum disorder often exhibit idiosyncratic patterns of
behaviors and interests. In this paper, we focus on measuring the presence of
idiosyncratic interests at the linguistic level in children with autism using
distributional semantic models. We model the semantic space of children's
narratives by calculating pairwise word overlap, and we compare the overlap
found within and across diagnostic groups. We find that the words used by
children with typical development tend to be used by other children with
typical development, while the words used by children with autism overlap less
with those used by children with typical development and even less with those
used by other children with autism. These findings suggest that children with
autism are veering not only away from the topic of the target narrative but
also in idiosyncratic semantic directions potentially defined by their
individual topics of interest.
