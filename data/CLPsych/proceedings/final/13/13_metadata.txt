Abstract#==#Title: Aided diagnosis of dementia type through computer-based analysis of
spontaneous speech.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a machine-learning induced
algorithm capable of classifying patients with frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and healthy controls using
acoustic and lexical features of spontaneous speech.

METHOD: We analyzed recordings of a brief spontaneous speech sample from 48
subjects from 5 diagnostic categories: healthy controls, Alzheimer's Disease
(AD), and three subtypes of Fronto-temporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD): Semantic
Dementia (SD), the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and
progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). Recordings were analyzed using a speech
recognition system optimized for speaker-independent spontaneous speech.  Bag
of word frequencies, pause and speech sound durations were then extracted.  The
resulting feature profiles were used as input to a machine learning system that
was trained to identify the diagnosis assigned to each research participant. We
evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system using five-fold cross
validation. 

RESULTS: Between groups lexical and acoustic differences in spontaneous speech
features were detected in accordance with expectations from prior research
literature. Machine learning algorithms were able to identify subjects’
diagnostic category with accuracy mostly on par with existing diagnostic
methods used by clinicians. For example, accuracy distinguishing between AD and
FTLD was 88%.

CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that our clinical speech analytic
approach can distinguish between controls and a number of dementia subtypes via
differences in lexico-acoustic profiles of speech. Diagnostic accuracy usually
on par with clinician accuracy                          despite speech sample
brevity.     

This suggest
the approach offers promise as an additional, objective and easily obtained
source of screening information for clinical neurologists and
neuropsychologists performing differential diagnosis.
