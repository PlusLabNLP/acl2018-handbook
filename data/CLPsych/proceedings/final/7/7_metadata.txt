Abstract#==#The ubiquity of social media provides a rich opportunity to enhance the data
available to mental health clinicians and researchers, enabling a
better-informed and better-equipped mental health field. We present analysis of
mental health phenomena in publicly available Twitter data, demonstrating how
rigorous application of simple natural language processing methods can yield
insight into specific disorders as well as mental health writ large, along with
evidence that as-of-yet undiscovered linguistic signals relevant to mental
health exist in social media. We present a novel method for gathering data for
a range of mental illnesses quickly and cheaply, then focus on analysis of four
in particular: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, bipolar
disorder,  and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). We intend for these
proof-of-concept results to inform the necessary ethical discussion regarding
the balance between the utility of such data and the privacy of mental health
related information.
