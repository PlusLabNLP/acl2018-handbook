Abstract#==#Discussion forums offer a new source of insight for the experiences and
challenges faced by individuals affected by mental disorders. Language
technology can help domain experts gather insight from these forums, by
aggregating themes and user behaviors across thousands of conversations. We
present a novel model for web forums, which captures both thematic content as
well as user-specific interests. Applying this model to the Aspies Central
forum (which covers issues related to Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and autism spectrum
disorder), we identify several topics of concern to individuals who report
being on the autism spectrum. We perform the evaluation on the data collected
from Aspies Central forum, including 1,939 threads, 29,947 posts and 972 users.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the topics extracted by this model
are substantially more than those obtained by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and
the Author-Topic Model. Qualitative analysis by subject-matter experts suggests
intriguing directions for future investigation.
