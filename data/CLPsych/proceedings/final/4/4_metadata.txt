Abstract#==#Violence risk assessment is an important and challenging task undertaken by
mental health professionals and others, in both clinical and nonclinical
settings. To date, computational linguistic techniques have not been used in
the risk assessment process. However they could contribute to the current
threat assessment process by allowing for early detection of elevated risk,
identification of risk factors for violence, monitoring of violent intent, and
determination of threat level. We analyzed a sample of communications to judges
that were referred to security personnel for evaluation as constituting
potential threats. We  categorized them along multiple dimensions including
evidence of mental illness, presence and nature of any threat, and level of
threat. While neither word count-based or topic models were able to effectively
predict elevated risk, we found topics indicative of persecutory beliefs,
paranoid ideation, and other symptoms of Axis I and Axis II disorders.
