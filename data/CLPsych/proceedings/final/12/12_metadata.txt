Abstract#==#Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. One of the major
challenges to suicide prevention is that those who may be most at risk cannot
be relied upon to report their conditions to clinicians. This paper takes an
initial step toward the automatic detection of suicidal risk factors through
social media activity, with no reliance on self-reporting.  We consider the
performance of annotators with various degrees of expertise in suicide
prevention at annotating microblog data for the purpose of training text-based
models for detecting suicide risk behaviors. Consistent with crowdsourcing
literature, we found that novice-novice annotator pairs underperform expert
annotators and outperform automatic lexical analysis tools, such as Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count.
