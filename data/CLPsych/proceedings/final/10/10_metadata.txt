Abstract#==#Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent,
and therapy is increasingly being offered online.  This new setting is
a departure from face-to-face therapy, and offers both a challenge and
an opportunity -- it is not yet known what features or approaches are
likely to lead to successful outcomes in such a different medium, but
online text-based therapy provides large amounts of data for
linguistic analysis.  We present an initial investigation into the
application of computational linguistic techniques, such as topic and
sentiment modelling, to online therapy for depression and anxiety. We
find that important measures such as symptom severity can be predicted
with comparable accuracy to face-to-face data, using general features
such as discussion topic and sentiment; however, measures of patient
progress are captured only by finer-grained lexical features,
suggesting that aspects of style or dialogue structure may also be important.
