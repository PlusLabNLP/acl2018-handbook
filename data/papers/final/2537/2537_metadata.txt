Abstract#==#Cross-modal language generation tasks such as image captioning
are directly hurt in their ability to support non-English languages
by the trend of data-hungry models combined with the lack of non-English annotations.
We investigate potential solutions for combining existing language-generation annotations
in English with translation capabilities in order to create solutions at
web-scale in both domain and language coverage.
We describe an approach called Pivot-Language Generation Stabilization (PLuGS),
which leverages directly at training time both existing English annotations
(gold data) as well as their machine-translated versions (silver data);
at run-time, it generates first an English caption and
then a corresponding target-language caption.
We show that PLuGS models outperform other candidate solutions in
evaluations performed over 5 different target languages,
under a large-domain testset using images from the Open Images dataset.
Furthermore, we find an interesting effect where the English captions
generated by the PLuGS models are better than
the captions generated by the original, monolingual English model.
