Abstract#==#Copy module has been widely equipped in the recent abstractive summarization models, 
which facilitates the decoder to extract words from the source into the summary.
Generally, the encoder-decoder attention is served as the copy distribution, 
while how to guarantee that important words in the source are copied remains a challenge. 
In this work, we propose a Transformer-based model to enhance the copy mechanism.
Specifically, we identify the importance of each source word based on the degree centrality with a directed graph built by the self-attention layer in the Transformer. 
We use the centrality of each source word to  guide the copy process explicitly.
Experimental results show that the self-attention graph provides useful guidance for the copy distribution. 
Our proposed models significantly outperform the 
baseline methods on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and the Gigaword dataset.
