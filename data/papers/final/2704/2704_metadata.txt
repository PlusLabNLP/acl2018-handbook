Abstract#==#As part of growing NLP capabilities, coupled
with an awareness of the ethical dimensions
of research, questions have been raised about
whether particular datasets and tasks should be
deemed off-limits for NLP research. We examine
this question with respect to a paper on
automatic legal sentencing from EMNLP 2019
which was a source of some debate, in asking
whether the paper should have been allowed to
be published, who should have been charged
with making such a decision, and on what basis.
We focus in particular on the role of data
statements in ethically assessing research, but
also discuss the topic of dual use, and examine
the outcomes of similar debates in other scientific
disciplines.
