Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the problem of identifying the principals and accessories from the fact description with multiple defendants in a criminal case. 
We treat the fact descriptions as narrative texts and the defendants as roles over the narrative story. We propose to model the defendants with \emph{behavioral semantic information} and \emph{statistical characteristics}, then learning the importances of defendants within a learning-to-rank framework. 
Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the behavior analysis can effectively model the defendants' impacts in a complex case.
