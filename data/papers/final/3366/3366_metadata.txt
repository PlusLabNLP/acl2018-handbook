Abstract#==#We present  a  constituency  parsing  algorithm that, like a supertagger, works by assigning labels  to  each  word  in  a  sentence.  In order to maximally leverage current neural architectures, the model scores each word's tags in parallel, with minimal task-specific structure.  After scoring, a left-to-right reconciliation phase extracts a tree in (empirically) linear time.  Our parser achieves 95.4 F1 on the WSJ test set while also achieving substantial speedups compared to current state-of-the-art parsers with comparable accuracies.
