Abstract#==#We present  a  simple  but  effective  method for aspect identification in sentiment analysis. Our unsupervised method only requires word embeddings  and  a  POS  tagger,  and  is  therefore straightforward to apply to new domains and languages.  We introduce Contrastive Attention (CAt), a novel single-head attention mechanism  based  on  an  RBF  kernel,  which gives a considerable boost in performance and makes the model interpretable. Previous work relied on syntactic features and complex neural  models. We  show  that  given  the  simplicity  of  current  benchmark  datasets  for  aspect extraction, such complex models are not needed.    The  code  to  reproduce  the  experiments  reported  in  this  paper  is  available  at https://github.com/clips/cat.
