Abstract#==#We present penalized expectation propagation, a novel algorithm for approximate
inference in graphical models. Expectation propagation is a variant of loopy
belief propagation that keeps messages tractable by projecting them back into
a given family of functions. Our extension speeds up the method by using a
structured-sparsity penalty to prefer simpler messages within the family.  In
the case of string-valued random variables, penalized EP lets us work with an
expressive non-parametric
function family based on variable-length n-gram models. On phonological
inference problems, we obtain substantial speedup over previous related
algorithms with no significant loss in accuracy.
