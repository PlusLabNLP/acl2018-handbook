Abstract#==#Showing items that do not match search query intent degrades customer experience in e-commerce. These mismatches result from counterfactual biases of the ranking algorithms toward noisy behavioral signals such as clicks and purchases in the search logs. Mitigating the problem requires a large labeled dataset, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain.  In this paper, we develop a deep, end-to-end model that learns to effectively classify mismatches and to generate hard mismatched examples to improve the classifier. We train the model end-to-end by introducing a latent variable into the cross-entropy loss that alternates between using the real and generated samples. This not only makes the classifier more robust but also  boosts the overall ranking performance. Our model achieves a relative gain compared to baselines by over $26\%$ in F-score, and over $17\%$ in Area Under PR curve. On live search traffic, our model gains significant improvement in multiple countries.
