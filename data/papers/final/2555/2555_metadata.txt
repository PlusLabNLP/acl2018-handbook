Abstract#==#This paper introduces Dynamic Programming
Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation algorithm
for tokenizing sentences into subword
units. We view the subword segmentation
of output sentences as a latent variable that
should be marginalized out for learning and
inference. A mixed character-subword transformer
is proposed, which enables exact log
marginal likelihood estimation and exact MAP
inference to find target segmentations with
maximum posterior probability. DPE uses
a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer
as a means of pre-processing parallel
data to segment output sentences using dynamic
programming. Empirical results on machine
translation suggest that DPE is effective
for segmenting output sentences and can be
combined with BPE dropout for stochastic segmentation
of source sentences. DPE achieves
an average improvement of 0.9 BLEU over
BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average
improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE
dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several
WMT datasets including English <=> (German,
Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian).
