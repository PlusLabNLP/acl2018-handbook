Abstract#==#This paper presents a tree-structured neural topic model, which has a topic distribution over a tree with an infinite number of branches.
Our model parameterizes an unbounded ancestral and fraternal topic distribution by applying doubly-recurrent neural networks.
With the help of autoencoding variational Bayes, our model improves data scalability and achieves competitive performance when inducing latent topics and tree structures, as compared to a prior tree-structured topic model (Blei et al., 2010).
This work extends the tree-structured topic model such that it can be incorporated with neural models for downstream tasks.
