Abstract#==#The key to effortless end-user programming is natural language.
We examine how to teach intelligent systems new functions, expressed in natural language.
As a first step, we collected 3168 samples of teaching efforts in plain English.
Then we built fuSE, a novel system that translates English function descriptions into code.
Our approach is three-tiered and each task is evaluated separately.
We first classify whether an intent to teach new functionality is present in the utterance (accuracy: 97.7\% using BERT).
Then we analyze the linguistic structure and construct a semantic model (accuracy: 97.6\% using a BiLSTM).
Finally, we synthesize the signature of the method, map the intermediate steps (instructions in the method body) to API calls and inject control structures (F\textsubscript{1}: 67.0\% with information retrieval and knowledge-based methods).
In an end-to-end evaluation on an unseen dataset fuSE synthesized 84.6\% of the method signatures and 79.2\% of the API calls correctly.
