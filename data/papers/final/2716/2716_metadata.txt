Abstract#==#We apply a generative segmental model of task structure, guided by narration, to action segmentation in video.  We focus on unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings where no action labels are known during training.  Despite its simplicity, our model performs competitively with previous work on a dataset of naturalistic instructional videos. Our model allows us to vary the sources of supervision used in training, and we find that both task structure and narrative language provide large benefits in segmentation quality.
