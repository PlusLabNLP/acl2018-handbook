Abstract#==#In this paper, we present CorefQA, an accurate and extensible approach for the coreference resolution task.
We formulate the problem as a span prediction task, like in question answering:
A query is generated for each candidate mention using its surrounding context, and a span prediction module is employed to extract the text spans of the coreferences within the document using the generated query.
This formulation comes with the following key advantages: 
(1) The span prediction strategy provides the flexibility of retrieving mentions left out at the mention proposal stage;
(2) In the question answering framework, encoding the mention and its context explicitly in a query makes it possible to have a deep and thorough examination of cues embedded in the context of coreferent mentions; and
(3) A plethora of existing question answering datasets can be used for data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability.
Experiments demonstrate significant performance boost over previous models, with 83.1 (+3.5) F1 score on the CoNLL-2012 benchmark and 87.5 (+2.5) F1 score on the GAP benchmark.
