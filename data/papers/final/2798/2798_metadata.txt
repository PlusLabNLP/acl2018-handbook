Abstract#==#Measuring the scholarly impact of a document without citations is an important and challenging problem. Existing approaches such as Document Inﬂuence Model (DIM) are based on dynamic topic models, which only consider the word frequency change. In this paper, we use both frequency changes and word semantic shifts to measure document inﬂuence by developing a neural network framework. Our model has three steps. Firstly, we train the word embeddings for different time periods. Subsequently, we propose an unsupervised method to align vectors for different time periods. Finally, we compute the inﬂuence value of documents. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms DIM.
