Abstract#==#This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised
dependency parsing at entire tree level, referred to as ambiguity-aware
ensemble
training. Instead of only using 1-best parse trees in previous work, our
core idea is to utilize parse forest (ambiguous labelings) to combine
multiple 1-best parse trees generated from diverse parsers on unlabeled data.
With a conditional random field based probabilistic dependency parser, our
training objective is to maximize mixed likelihood of labeled data and
auto-parsed
unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings. This framework offers two promising
advantages. 1) ambiguity encoded in parse forests compromises noise in 1-best
parse trees. During training, the parser is aware of these ambiguous
structures, and
has the flexibility to distribute probability mass to its preferred parse trees
as long
as the likelihood improves. 2) diverse syntactic structures produced by
different
parsers can be naturally compiled into forest, offering complementary strength
to our single-view parser. Experimental results on benchmark data show that
our method significantly outperforms the baseline supervised parser and
other entire-tree based semi-supervised methods, such as self-training,
co-training
and tri-training.
