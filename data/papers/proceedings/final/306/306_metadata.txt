Abstract#==#We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT)
that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an
extrinsic response to a translation input. We show how to generate responses by
grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query
against a database. Experiments on the Geoquery database show an improvement of
about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over learning from
references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a
translated query. In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human
reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured
learning for SMT.
