Abstract#==#Unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods are an
  attractive approach to all-words WSD due to their non-reliance on
  expensive annotated data. Estimates of sense frequency
  have been shown to be very useful for WSD due to the skewed nature of
  word sense distributions. This paper presents a fully unsupervised
  topic modelling-based approach to sense frequency estimation, which is
  highly portable to different corpora and sense inventories, in being
  applicable to any part of speech, and not requiring a hierarchical
  sense inventory, parsing or parallel text.  We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the method over the tasks of predominant sense
  learning and sense distribution acquisition, and also the novel tasks
  of detecting senses which aren't attested in the corpus, and
  identifying novel senses in the corpus which aren't captured in the
  sense inventory.
