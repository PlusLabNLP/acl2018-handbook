Abstract#==#Abstract meaning representation is a semantic formalism for which a growing set
of annotated examples is available.  We introduce the first approach to parsing
sentences into this representation, providing a strong baseline for future
improvement.  The method is based on a novel algorithm for finding a maximum
spanning, connected subgraph, embedded within a Lagrangian relaxation of a hard
optimization problem that imposes linguistically inspired constraints. Our
approach is described in the general framework of structured prediction,
allowing future incorporation of additional features and constraints, and may
extend to other formalisms as well.
