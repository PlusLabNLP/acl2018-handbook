Abstract#==#We propose three improvements to address the drawbacks of state-of-the-art
transition-based constituent parsers. First, to resolve the error propagation
problem of the traditional pipeline approach, we incorporate POS tagging into
the syntactic parsing process. Second, to alleviate the negative influence of
size differences among competing action sequences, we align parser states
during beam-search decoding. Third, to enhance the power of parsing models, we
enlarge the feature set with non-local features and semi-supervised word
cluster features. Experimental results show that these modifications improve
parsing performance significantly. Evaluated on the Chinese TreeBank (CTB), our
final performance reaches 86.3% (F1) when trained on CTB 5.1, and 87.1% when
trained on CTB 6.0, and these results outperform all state-of-the-art parsers.
