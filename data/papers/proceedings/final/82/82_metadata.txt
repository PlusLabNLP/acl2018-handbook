Abstract#==#Statistical phrase-based translation learns translation rules from bilingual
corpora, and has traditionally only used monolingual evidence to construct
features that rescore existing translation candidates.                          In
this
work, we
present a semi-supervised graph-based approach for generating new translation
rules that leverages bilingual and monolingual data.  The proposed technique
first constructs phrase graphs using both source and target language
monolingual corpora.  Next, graph propagation identifies translations of
phrases that were not observed in the bilingual corpus, assuming that similar
phrases have similar translations.  We report results on a large Arabic-English
system and a medium-sized Urdu-English system.                          Our proposed
approach
significantly improves the performance of competitive phrase-based systems,
leading to consistent improvements between 1 and 4 BLEU points on standard
evaluation sets.
