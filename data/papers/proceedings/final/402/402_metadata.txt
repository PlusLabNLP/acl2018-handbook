Abstract#==#This paper tackles the sparsity problem in estimating phrase translation
probabilities by learning continuous phrase representations, whose distributed
nature enables the sharing of related phrases in their representations. A pair
of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector
representations in a low-dimensional latent space, where their translation
score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space. The
projection is performed by a neural network whose weights are learned on
parallel training data. Experimental evaluation has been performed on two WMT
translation tasks. Our best result improves the performance of a
state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained on
WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.3 BLEU points.
