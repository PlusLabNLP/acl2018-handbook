Abstract#==#We present an approach to training a joint syntactic and semantic parser that
combines syntactic training information from CCGbank with semantic training
information from a knowledge base via distant supervision. The trained parser
produces a full syntactic parse of any sentence, while simultaneously producing
logical forms for portions of the sentence that have a semantic representation
within the parser’s predicate vocabulary. We demonstrate our approach by
training a parser whose semantic representation contains 130 predicates from
the NELL ontology. A semantic evaluation demonstrates that this parser produces
logical forms better than both comparable prior work and a pipelined
syntax-then-semantics approach. A syntactic evaluation on CCGbank demonstrates
that the parser’s dependency F- score is within 2.5% of state-of-the-art.
