Abstract#==#We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification using
distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context; this
technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word
embeddings. Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a
model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context
around a predicate to a low dimensional representation. The latter is used for
semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method
inspired by prior work, we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style
frame-semantic analysis. Additionally, we report strong results on
PropBank-style semantic role
labeling in comparison to prior work.
