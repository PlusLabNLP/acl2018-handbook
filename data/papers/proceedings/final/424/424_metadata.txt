Abstract#==#This paper explores a simple and effective unified framework for incorporating
soft linguistic reordering constraints into a hierarchical phrase-based
translation system: 1) a syntactic reordering model that explores reorderings
for context free grammar rules; and 2) a semantic reordering model that focuses
on the reordering of predicate-argument structures. We develop novel features
based on both models and use them as soft constraints to guide the translation
process. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering
approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based
translation system. However, the gain achieved by the semantic reordering model
is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering model, and we therefore
provide a detailed analysis of the behavior differences between the two.
