Abstract#==#Wikification for tweets aims to automatically identify each concept mention in
a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (e.g.,
Wikipedia). Due to the shortness of a tweet, a collective inference model
incorporating global evidence from multiple mentions and concepts is more
appropriate than a non-collecitve approach which links each mention at a time.
In addition, it is challenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data
for supervised models with low cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and
global evidence from multiple tweets through three novel fine-grained
relations. In order to identify semantically-related mentions for collective
inference, we detect meta path-based semantic relations through social
networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100%
labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31%
labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled data.
