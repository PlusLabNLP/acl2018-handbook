Abstract#==#Automatic extraction of new words is an indispensable precursor to many NLP
tasks such as Chinese word segmentation, named entity extraction, and sentiment
analysis.
This paper aims at extracting new sentiment words from large-scale
user-generated content.
 We propose a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven framework for this
purpose.
We design statistical measures respectively to quantify the utility of a
lexical pattern and
to measure the possibility of a word being a new word.
The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and
requires no elaborated linguistic rules.
We also demonstrate how new sentiment word will benefit sentiment analysis.
 Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
