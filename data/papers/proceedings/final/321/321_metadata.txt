Abstract#==#Widely used in speech and language processing, Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing has
consistently been shown to be one of the best-performing smoothing methods.
However, KN smoothing assumes integer counts, limiting its potential uses---for
example, inside Expectation-Maximization. In this paper, we propose a
generalization of KN smoothing that operates on fractional counts, or, more
precisely, on *distributions* over counts. We rederive all the steps of KN
smoothing to operate on count distributions instead of integral counts, and
apply it  to two tasks where KN smoothing was not applicable before: one in
language model adaptation, and the other in word alignment. In both cases, our
method improves performance significantly.
