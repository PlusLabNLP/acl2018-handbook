Abstract#==#Semantic hierarchy construction aims to build structures of concepts linked by
hypernym–hyponym (“is-a”) relations. A major challenge for this task is
the automatic discovery of such relations. This paper proposes a novel and
effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on word
embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between
words. We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym–hyponym
relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words
and their hypernyms. Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the
state-of-theart methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Moreover, combining
our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can
further improve Fscore to 80.29%.
