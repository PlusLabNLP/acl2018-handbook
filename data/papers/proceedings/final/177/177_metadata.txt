Abstract#==#Discussion forums have evolved into a dependable source of knowledge to solve
common problems. However, only a minority of the posts in discussion forums are
solution posts. Identifying solution posts from discussion forums, hence, is an
important research problem. In this paper, we present a technique for
unsupervised solution post identification leveraging a so far unexplored
textual feature, that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions.
We use translation models and language models to exploit lexical correlations
and solution post character respectively. Our technique is designed to not rely
much on structural features such as post metadata since such features are often
not uniformly available across forums. Our clustering-based iterative solution
identification approach based on the EM-formulation performs favorably in an
empirical evaluation, beating the only unsupervised solution identification
technique from literature by a very large margin. We also show that our
unsupervised technique is competitive against methods that require supervision,
outperforming one such technique comfortably.
