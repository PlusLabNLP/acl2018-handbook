Abstract#==#It is very import for Chinese language processing with the aid of an efficient
input method engine (IME), of which pinyin-to-Chinese (PTC) conversion is the
core part. Meanwhile, though typos are inevitable during user pinyin inputting,
existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience. In this paper,
motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms, we propose a joint
graph model to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME. The
evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms both existing
academic and commercial IMEs.
