Abstract#==#Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) usually utilizes contextual information
to disambiguate translation candidates. However, it is often limited to
contexts within sentence boundaries, hence broader topical information cannot
be leveraged.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic
representation for parallel data using a neural network architecture, where
abundant topical contexts are embedded via topic relevant monolingual data. By
associating each translation rule with the topic representation, topic relevant
rules are selected according to the distributional similarity with the source
text during SMT decoding. Experimental results show that our method
significantly improves translation accuracy in the NIST Chinese-to-English
translation task compared to a state-of-the-art baseline.
