Abstract#==#Vector space models (VSMs) represent word meanings as points in a high
dimensional space. VSMs are typically created using a large text corpora, and
so represent word semantics as observed in text. We present a new algorithm
(JNNSE) that can incorporate a measure of semantics not previously used to
create VSMs: brain activation data recorded while people read words. The
resulting model takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses
of corpus and brain activation data to give a more complete representation of
semantics. Evaluations show that the model 1) matches a behavioral measure of
semantics more closely, 2) can be used to predict corpus data for unseen words
and 3) has predictive power that generalizes across brain imaging technologies
and across subjects. We believe that the model is thus a more faithful
representation of mental vocabularies.
