Abstract#==#Transitional expressions provide glue that holds ideas together in a text and
enhance the logical organization, which together help improve readability of a
text. However, in most current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems,
the outputs of compound-complex sentences still lack proper transitional
expressions. As a result, the translations are often hard to read and
understand. To address this issue, we propose two novel models to en-courage
generating such transitional expressions by introducing the source
compound-complex sentence structure (CSS). Our models include a CSS-based
translation model, which generates new CSS-based translation rules, and a
generative transfer model, which encourages producing transitional expressions
during decoding. The two models are integrated into a hierarchical phrase-based
translation system to evaluate their effectiveness. The experimental results
show that significant improvements are achieved on various test data while the
translations are more cohesive and smooth.
