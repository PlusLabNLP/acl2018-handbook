Abstract#==#Many machine learning datasets are noisy with a substantial number of
mislabeled instances. This noise yields sub-optimal classification performance.
In this paper we study a large, low quality annotated dataset, created quickly
and cheaply using Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource annotations. We
describe computationally cheap feature weighting techniques and a novel
non-linear distribution spreading algorithm that can be used to iteratively and
interactively correcting mislabeled instances to significantly improve
annotation quality at low cost. Eight different emotion extraction experiments
on Twitter data demonstrate that our approach is just as effective as more
computationally expensive techniques. Our techniques save a considerable amount
of time.
