Abstract#==#Chinese language is an ancient hieroglyphic. It is inattentive to structure.
Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate.
In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for
Chinese relation extraction. The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in
a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation. In
order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss
how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency. Both Omni-word
feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and
minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmentation and parsing. We
test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus. The results show a
significant improvement in Chinese relation extraction, outperforming other
methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes.
