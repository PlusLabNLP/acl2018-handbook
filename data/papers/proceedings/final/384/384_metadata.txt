Abstract#==#Existing models for social media personal analytics assume access to
thousands of messages per user, even though most users author content
only sporadically over time.  Given this sparsity, we: (i) leverage
content from the local neighborhood of a user; (ii) evaluate batch
models as a function of size and the amount of messages in various
types of neighborhoods; and (iii) estimate the amount of time and
tweets required for a dynamic model to predict user preferences. We
show that even when limited or no self-authored data is available,
language from friend, retweet and user mention communications provide
sufficient evidence for prediction.  When updating models over time
based on Twitter, we find that political preference can be often be
predicted using roughly 100 tweets, depending on the context of user
selection, where this could mean hours, or weeks, based on the
author's tweeting frequency.
