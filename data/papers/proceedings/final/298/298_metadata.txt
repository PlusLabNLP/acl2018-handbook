Abstract#==#Lexical resource alignment has been an active field of research over the last
decade. However, prior methods for aligning lexical resources have been either
specific to a particular pair of resources, or heavily dependent on the
availability of hand-crafted alignment data for the pair of resources to be
aligned. Here we present a unified approach that can be applied to an arbitrary
pair of lexical resources, including machine-readable dictionaries with no
network structure. Our approach leverages a similarity measure that enables the
structural comparison of senses across lexical resources, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the task of aligning WordNet to three different
collaborative resources: Wikipedia, Wiktionary and OmegaWiki.
