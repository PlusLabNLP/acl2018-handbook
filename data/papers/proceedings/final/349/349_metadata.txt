Abstract#==#We show that it is possible to reliably discriminate whether a syntactic
construction is meant literally or metaphorically using lexical semantic
features of the words that participate in the construction. Our model is
constructed using English resources, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance
relative to previous work in this language. Using a model transfer approach by
pivoting through a bilingual dictionary, we show our model can identify
metaphoric expressions in other languages. We provide results on three new test
sets in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian. The results support the hypothesis that
metaphors are conceptual, rather than lexical, in nature.
