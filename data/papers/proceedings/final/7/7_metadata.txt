Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel framework called error case frames for correcting
preposition errors. They are case frames specially designed for describing and
correcting preposition errors. Their most distinct advantage is that they can
correct errors with feedback messages explaining why the preposition
is erroneous. This paper proposes a method for automatically generating them by
comparing learner and native corpora. Experiments show that error correction
with feedback messages provided by error case frames are effective in language
learning assistance, achieving a correction performance comparable to
conventional methods.
