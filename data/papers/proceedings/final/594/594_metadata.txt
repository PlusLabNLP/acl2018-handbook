Abstract#==#Sentence compression has been shown to benefit from joint inference over n-gram
and dependency-based objectives but this typically requires expensive integer
programming. We explore instead the use of Lagrangian relaxation to decouple
the two subproblems and solve them separately. While dynamic programming is
viable for bigram-based sentence compression, finding optimal compressed trees
in graphs is NP-hard. We recover approximate solutions to this problem using LP
relaxation and maximum spanning tree algorithms, yielding techniques that can
be combined with the efficient bigram-based inference approach using Lagrange
multipliers. Experiments show that these approximation strategies produce
results comparable to a state-of-the-art integer linear programming formulation
for the same joint inference task along with a significant improvement in
runtime.
