Abstract#==#An important search task in the biomedical domain is to find medical records of
patients who are qualified for a clinical trial. One commonly used approach is
to apply NLP tools to map terms from queries and documents to concepts and then
compute the relevance scores based on the concept-based representation.
However,the mapping results are not perfect, and none of previous work studied
how to deal with them in the retrieval process. In this paper, we focus on
addressing the limitations caused by the imperfect mapping results and study
how to further improve the retrieval performance of the concept-based ranking
methods. In particular, we apply axiomatic approaches and propose two weighting
regularization methods that adjust the weighting based on the relations among
the concepts. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are effective
to improve the retrieval performance, and their performances are comparable to
other top-performing systems in the TREC Medical Records Track.
