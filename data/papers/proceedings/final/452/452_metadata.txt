Abstract#==#We propose a spectral approach for unsupervised constituent parsing that comes
with theoretical guarantees on latent structure recovery. Our approach is
grammarless – we directly learn the bracketing structure of a given sentence
without using a grammar model. The main algorithm is based on lifting the
concept of additive tree metrics for structure learning of latent trees in the
phylogenetic and machine learning communities to the case where the tree
structure varies across examples. Although finding the “minimal” latent
tree
is NP-hard in general, for the case of projective trees we find that it can be
found using bilexical parsing algorithms. Empirically, our algorithm performs
favorably compared to the constituent context model of Klein and Manning (2002)
without the need for careful initialization.
