Abstract#==#Negative expressions are common in natural language text and play a critical
role in information extraction. However, the performances of current systems
are far from satisfaction, largely due to its focus on intra-sentence
information and its failure to consider inter-sentence information. In this
paper, we propose a graph model to enrich intra-sentence features with
inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives. Evaluation on
the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus indicates the usefulness of contextual
discourse information in negation focus identification and justifies the
effectiveness of our graph model in capturing such global information.
