Abstract#==#Although the distributional hypothesis has been applied successfully in many
natural language processing tasks,
systems using distributional information have been limited to a single domain
because
the distribution of a word can vary between domains as the word's predominant
meaning changes.
However, if it were possible to predict how the distribution
of a word changes from one domain to another, the predictions could be used to
adapt a system trained in one domain to work in another.
We propose an unsupervised method to predict the distribution of
a word in one domain, given its distribution in another domain.
We evaluate our method on two tasks: cross-domain part-of-speech tagging
and cross-domain sentiment classification. In both tasks, our method
significantly outperforms 
competitive baselines and returns results that are statistically comparable to
current state-of-the-art methods,
while requiring no task-specific customisations.
