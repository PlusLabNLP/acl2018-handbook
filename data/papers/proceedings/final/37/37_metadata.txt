Abstract#==#Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been
increasingly focused on for their ability to alleviate the burden of manual
feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for
Chinese word segmentation called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network (MMTNN). By
exploiting tag embedding and tensor-based transformation, MMTNN has the ability
to model complicated interactions between tags and context characters.
Furthermore, a new tensor factorization approach is proposed to speed up the
model and avoid overfitting. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our
model achieves better performances than previous neural network models and that
our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature
engineering. Despite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, MMTNN can
be easily generalized and applied to other sequence labeling tasks.
