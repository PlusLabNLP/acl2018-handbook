Abstract#==#Inspired by experimental psychological findings suggesting that
function words play a special role in word learning, we make a
simple modification to an Adaptor Grammar based Bayesian word
segmentation model to allow it to learn sequences of monosyllabic
``function words'' at the beginnings and endings of collocations of
(possibly multi-syllabic) words.  This modification improves
unsupervised word segmentation on the standard
Bernstein-Ratner (1987) corpus of child-directed English by more
than 4% token f-score compared to a model identical except that it
does not special-case ``function words'', setting a new
state-of-the-art of 92.4% token f-score.
Our function word model assumes that function words appear at the
left periphery, and while this is true of languages such as
English, it is not true universally.  We show that a learner can
use Bayesian model selection to determine the location of function
words in their language, even though the input to the model only
consists of unsegmented sequences of phones.  Thus our computational
models support the hypothesis that function words play a special
role in word learning.
