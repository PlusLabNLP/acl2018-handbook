Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a manifold model for medical relation
extraction. Our model is built upon a medical corpus containing
80M sentences (11 gigabyte text) and designed to accurately and
efficiently detect the key medical relations that can facilitate
clinical decision making. Our approach integrates domain specific
parsing and typing systems, and can utilize labeled as well as
unlabeled examples. To provide users with more flexibility, we
also take label weight into consideration. Effectiveness of our
model is demonstrated both theoretically with a proof to show that
the solution is a closed-form solution and experimentally with
positive results in experiments.
