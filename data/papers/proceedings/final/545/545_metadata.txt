Abstract#==#We present a parser that relies primarily on extracting information
directly from surface spans rather than on propagating information
through enriched grammar structure. For example, instead of creating
separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP, our
parser might instead capture the same information from the first
word of the NP. Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface
features can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser:
because so many deep syntactic cues have surface reflexes, our
system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as
minimal as X-bar grammars. Keeping the structural backbone simple
and moving features to the surface also allows easy adaptation to
new languages and even to new tasks. On the SPMRL 2013 multilingual
constituency parsing shared task (Seddah et al., 2013), our system
outperforms the top single parser system of Bj√∂rkelund et al.                       
 
(2013)
on a range of languages. In addition, despite being designed for
syntactic analysis, our system also achieves state-of-the-art numbers
on the structural sentiment task of Socher et al. (2013).  Finally,
we show that, in both syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis,
many broad linguistic trends can be captured via surface features.
