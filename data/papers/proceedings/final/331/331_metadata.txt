Abstract#==#We consider the problem of automatically inferring latent character types in a
collection of 15,099 English novels published between 1700 and 1899. Unlike
prior work in which character types are assumed responsible for
probabilistically generating all text associated with a character, we introduce
a model that employs multiple effects to account for the influence of
extra-linguistic information (such as author).                            In an
empirical
evaluation, we find that this method leads to improved agreement with the
preregistered
judgments of a literary scholar, complementing the results of alternative
models.
