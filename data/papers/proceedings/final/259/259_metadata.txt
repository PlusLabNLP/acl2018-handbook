Abstract#==#This paper is concerned with building linguistic resources and statistical
parsers for deep grammatical relation (GR) analysis of Chinese texts. A set of
linguistic rules that are grounded in the Government and Binding theory is
defined to explore implicit phrase structural information and thus build
high-quality GR annotations that are represented as general directed dependency
graphs. The reliability of this linguistically-motivated GR extraction
procedure is highlighted by manual evaluation. Based on the converted corpus,
we study transition-based, data-driven models for GR parsing. We present a
novel transition system which suits GR graphs better than existing systems.
The key idea is to introduce a new type of transition that reorders top k
elements in the memory module. Evaluation gauges how successful GR parsing for
Chinese can be by applying data-driven models.
