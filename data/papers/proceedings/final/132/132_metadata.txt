Abstract#==#We present CoSimRank, a new graphtheoretic similarity measure that is efficient
because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the
similarities of the entire graph. We present equivalent formalizations that
show CoSimRank’s close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank and
also show how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms to
compute CoSimRank. Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly
extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic
similarity measures. In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym
extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction, CoSimRank is faster or more
accurate than previous approaches.
