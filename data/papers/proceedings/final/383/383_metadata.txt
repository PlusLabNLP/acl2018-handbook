Abstract#==#We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for
conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user
information needs. We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based
on the overall content and the phrasal query information. We cluster the
selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the
sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model. We propose a ranking
strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based
abstract sentence for each cluster. A resulting summary consists of abstractive
sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of
the conversation. Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat
and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms
baselines and previous extractive models.
