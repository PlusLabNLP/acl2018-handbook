Abstract#==#In this work, we revisit Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: the
automated analysis of negation. Unlike the vast majority of participating
systems in 2012, our approach works over explicit and formal representations of
propositional semantics, i.e. derives the notion of negation scope assumed in
this task from the structure of logical-form meaning representations. We relate
the task-specific interpretation of (negation) scope to the concept of
(quantifier and operator) scope in mainstream underspecified semantics. With
reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure, we
can operationalize the annotation decisions made for the 2012 *SEM task, and
demonstrate how a comparatively simple system for negation scope resolution can
be built from an off-the-shelf deep parsing system. In a system combination
setting, our approach improves over the best published results on this task to
date.
