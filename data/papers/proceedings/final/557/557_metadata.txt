Abstract#==#We present an approach for automatically learning to solve algebra word
problems given only text.  Successfully solving these problems requires
handling complex semantic relations which cross sentences, such as determining
that the distinct entities mentioned in various sentences are all a part of the
same set.  Our algorithm first determines the relation between entities in the
text, and then translates these into a system of equations.  The algorithm is
trained in a weak supervision setting, where we are only given the text and the
resulting numerical answers, without information on the entity relations or the
underlying equations.  Despite this relatively weak supervision, we are able to
successfully generate the correct answer set for 77% of the problems on a
dataset of actual grade-school algebra problems, compared to the 26% produced
by a baseline which is agnostic to semantic relations.
