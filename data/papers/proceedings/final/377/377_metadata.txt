Abstract#==#We introduce three linguistically motivated structured regularizers
based on parse trees, topics, and hierarchical word clusters for text
categorization.
These regularizers impose linguistic bias in feature weights,
enabling us to incorporate prior knowledge into conventional bag-of-words
models.
We show that our structured regularizers consistently improve
classification accuracies compared to
standard regularizers that penalize features in isolation (such
as lasso, ridge, and elastic net regularizers) on a range of datasets
for various text prediction problems: topic classification, sentiment analysis,
and forecasting.
