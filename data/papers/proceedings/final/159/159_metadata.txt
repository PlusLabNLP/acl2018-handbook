Abstract#==#Consumersâ€™ purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated
online re- views. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the
potential for posting deceptive opinion spam fictitious reviews that have been
deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the readers. In this paper,
we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam
based on a new gold standard data, which is comprised of data from four
different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Airline, Doctor), each of which
contains three types of reviews, i.e. costumer generated truthful reviews,
Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated
deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of
language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews and we hope that it would
be of help to customers when making purchase decisions, and review portal
operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp to investigate fraudulent activity on
their sites.
