Abstract#==#Answering natural language questions using the Freebase knowledge base has
recently been explored as a platform for advancing the state of the art in open
domain semantic parsing. Those efforts map questions to sophisticated meaning
representations that are then attempted to be matched against viable answer
candidates in the knowledge base. Here we show that relatively modest
information extraction techniques, when paired with a web-scale corpus, can
outperform these sophisticated approaches by roughly 34%
relative gain.
