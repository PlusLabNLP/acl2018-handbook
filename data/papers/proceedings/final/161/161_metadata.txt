Abstract#==#Text-level discourse parsing remains a challenge. The current state-of-the-art
overall accuracy in relation assignment is 55.73%, achieved by Joty et
al.(2013). However, their model has a high order of time complexity, and thus
cannot be applied in practice. In this work, we develop a much faster model
whose time complexity is linear in the number of sentences. Our model adopts a
greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as
local classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional
constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF. In addition to
efficiency, our parser also significantly outperforms the state of the art.
Moreover, our novel approach of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built tree
by considering information from constituents on upper levels, can further
improve the accuracy.
