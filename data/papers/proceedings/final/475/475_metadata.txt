Abstract#==#The sentiment captured in opinionated text provides interesting and
valuable information for social media services.  However, due to the
complexity and diversity of linguistic representations, it is
challenging to build a framework that accurately extracts such
sentiment.  We propose a semi-supervised framework for generating a
domain-specific sentiment lexicon and inferring sentiments at the
segment level.                                      Our framework can greatly reduce
the
human
effort for building a domain-specific sentiment lexicon with high
quality.  Specifically, in our evaluation, working with just 20
manually labeled reviews, it generates a domain-specific sentiment
lexicon that yields weighted average F-Measure gains of 3%.  Our
sentiment classification model achieves approximately 1% greater 
accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach based on elementary
discourse units.
