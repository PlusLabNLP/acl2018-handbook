Abstract#==#We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an
  underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative
  goal. We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process
  with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the
  communicative goal. We then use probabilistic planning to solve the
  MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability,
  accomplishes the communicative goal. We show empirically that our
  approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally
  matches or surpasses the state of the art. Further, we show that our
  approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals,
  including negated goals.
