Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from verb
uses in giga-word corpora. Our method consists of two clustering steps:
verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering
verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are
induced by clustering these frames. By taking this step-wise approach,
we can not only generate verb classes based on a massive amount of verb
uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy, which is
bypassed by most of the previous studies on verb clustering.
In our experiments, we acquire semantic frames and verb classes from
two giga-word corpora, the larger comprising 20 billion words. The
effectiveness of our approach is verified through quantitative
evaluations based on polysemy-aware gold-standard data.
