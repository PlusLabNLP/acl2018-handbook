Abstract#==#Representing predicates in terms of their argument distribution is common
practice in NLP. Multi-word predicates (MWPs) in this context are often either
disregarded or considered as fixed expressions. The latter treatment is
unsatisfactory in two ways: (1) identifying MWPs is notoriously difficult, (2)
MWPs show varying degrees of compositionality and could benefit from taking
into account the identity of their component parts. We propose a novel approach
that integrates the distributional representation of multiple sub-sets of the
MWP's words. We assume a latent distribution over sub-sets of the MWP, and
estimate it relative to a downstream prediction task. Focusing on the
supervised identification of lexical inference relations, we compare against
state-of-the-art baselines that consider a single sub-set of an MWP, obtaining
substantial improvements. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address
lexical relations between MWPs of varying degrees of compositionality within
distributional semantics.
