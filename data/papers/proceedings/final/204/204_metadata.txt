Abstract#==#Earnings call summarizes the financial performance of a company, and it is an
important indicator of the future financial risks of the company. We
quantitatively study how earnings calls are correlated with the financial
risks, with a special focus on the financial crisis of 2009. In particular, we
perform a text regression task: given the transcript of an earnings call, we
predict the volatility of stock prices from the week after the call is made. We
propose the use of copula: a powerful statistical framework that separately
models the uniform marginals and their complex multivariate stochastic
dependencies, while not requiring any prior assumptions on the distributions of
the covariate and the dependent variable. By performing probability integral
transform, our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-of-words
models in NLP, and improves previous work on text regression by incorporating
the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian
copula. In experiments, we show that our model significantly outperforms strong
linear and non-linear discriminative baselines on three datasets under various
settings.
