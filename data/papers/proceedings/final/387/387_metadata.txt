Abstract#==#We investigate different ways of learning structured perceptron models for
coreference resolution when using non-local features and beam search. Our
experimental results indicate that standard techniques such as early updates or
Learning as Search Optimization (LaSO) perform worse than a greedy baseline
that only uses local features. By modifying LaSO to delay updates until the end
of each instance we obtain significant improvements over the baseline. Our
model obtains the best results to date on recent shared task data for Arabic,
Chinese, and English.
