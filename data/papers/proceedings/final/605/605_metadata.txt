Abstract#==#Entity clustering must determine when two named-entity mentions refer to the
same entity. Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the
mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity. In
this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that
achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data. The generative
process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally
mutating an earlier name from a similar context.  Clustering the mentions into
entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models
of the mutation process and parent selection process.  We present a block Gibbs
sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several
datasets.
