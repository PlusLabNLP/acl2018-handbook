Abstract#==#Cross-narrative temporal ordering of medical events is essential to the task of
generating a comprehensive timeline over a patient's history. We address the
problem of aligning multiple medical event sequences, corresponding to
different clinical narratives, comparing the following approaches: (1) A novel
weighted finite state transducer representation of medical event sequences that
enables composition and search for decoding, and (2) Dynamic programming with
iterative pairwise alignment of multiple sequences using global and local
alignment algorithms. The cross-narrative coreference and temporal relation
weights used in both these approaches are learned from a corpus of clinical
narratives. We present results using both approaches and observe that the
finite state transducer approach performs performs significantly better than
the dynamic programming one by 6.8% for the problem of multiple-sequence
alignment.
