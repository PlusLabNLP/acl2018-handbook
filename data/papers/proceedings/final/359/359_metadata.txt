Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate various strategies to predict both syntactic
dependency parsing and contiguous multiword expression (MWE) recognition,
testing them on the dependency version of French Treebank, as instantiated in
the SPMRL Shared Task. Our work focuses on using an alternative representation
of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal
structure. We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous
works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the
internal structure of MWEs. This can be useful for capturing the various
degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs.
