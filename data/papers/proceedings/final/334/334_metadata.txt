Abstract#==#We aim to improve spoken term detection performance by incorporating contextual
information beyond traditional N-gram language models.              Instead of taking
a
broad view of topic context in spoken documents, variability of word
co-occurrence statistics across corpora leads us to focus instead the on
phenomenon of word repetition within single documents.              We show that
given the
detection of one instance of a term we are more likely to detect additional
instances of that term in the same document. We leverage term 'burstiness' for
each keyword by taking the most confident hypothesis in each document and
interpolating with lower scoring hits.              We then develop a principled
approach
to select interpolation weights using only the ASR training data.  Using our
re-weighting approach we demonstrate up to 1.5% absolute performance
improvement on the term detection task in all Babel program languages.
