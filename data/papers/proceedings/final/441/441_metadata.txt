Abstract#==#The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language
understanding. We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of
sentences. The network uses Dynamic k-Max Pooling, a global pooling operation
over linear sequences. The network handles input sentences of varying length
and induces a feature graph over the sentence that  is capable of explicitly
capturing short and long-range relations. The network does not rely on a parse
tree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four
experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way
question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant
supervision. The network achieves excellent performance in the first three
tasks and a greater than 25% error reduction in the last task with respect to
the strongest baseline.
