Abstract#==#Accurate scoring of syntactic structures such as head-modifier arcs in
dependency parsing typically requires rich, high-dimensional feature
representations. A small subset of such features is often selected manually.
This is problematic when features lack clear linguistic meaning as in
embeddings or when the information is blended across features. In this paper,
we use tensors to map high-dimensional feature vectors into low dimensional
representations. We explicitly maintain the parameters as a low-rank tensor to
obtain low dimensional representations of words in their syntactic roles, and
to leverage modularity in the tensor for easy training with online algorithms.
Our parser consistently outperforms the Turbo and MST parsers across 14
different languages. We also obtain the best published UAS results on 5
languages.
