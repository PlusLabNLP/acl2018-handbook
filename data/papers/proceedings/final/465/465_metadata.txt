Abstract#==#Traditional models of distributional semantics suffer from computational issues
such as data sparsity for individual lexemes and complexities of modeling
semantic composition when dealing with structures larger than single lexical
items. In this work, we present a frequency-driven paradigm for robust
distributional semantics in terms of semantically cohesive lineal constituents,
or motifs. The framework subsumes issues such as differential compositional as
well as non-compositional behavior of phrasal consituents, and circumvents some
problems of data sparsity by design. We design a segmentation model to
optimally partition a sentence into lineal constituents, which can be used to
define distributional contexts that are less noisy, semantically more
interpretable, and linguistically disambiguated. Hellinger PCA embeddings
learnt using the framework show competitive results on empirical tasks.
