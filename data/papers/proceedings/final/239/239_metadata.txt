Abstract#==#We present a simple, data-driven approach to generation from knowledge bases
(KB). A key feature of this approach is that grammar induction is driven by the
extended domain of locality principle of TAG (Tree Adjoining Grammar); and that
it takes into account both syntactic and semantic information. The resulting
extracted TAG includes a unification based semantics and can be used by an
existing surface realiser to generate sentences from KB data. Experimental
evaluation on the KBGen data shows that our model outperforms a data-driven
generate-and-rank approach based on an automatically induced probabilistic
grammar; and is comparable with a handcrafted symbolic approach.
