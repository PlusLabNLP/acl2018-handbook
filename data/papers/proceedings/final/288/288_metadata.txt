Abstract#==#We introduce the problem of generation in distributional semantics: Given a
distributional vector representing some meaning, how can we generate the phrase
that best expresses that meaning? We motivate this novel challenge on
theoretical and practical grounds and propose a simple data-driven approach to
the estimation of generation functions. We test this in a monolingual scenario
(paraphrase generation) as well as in a cross-lingual setting (translation by
synthesizing adjective-noun phrase vectors in English and generating the
equivalent expressions in Italian).
