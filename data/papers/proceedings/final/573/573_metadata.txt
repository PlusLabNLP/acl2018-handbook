Abstract#==#This paper presents the first dependency model for a shift-reduce
CCG parser. Modelling dependencies is desirable for a number of
reasons, including handling the "spurious" ambiguity of CCG;
fitting well with the theory of CCG; and optimizing for structures
which are evaluated at test time. We develop a novel training
technique using a dependency oracle, in which all derivations are
hidden. A challenge arises from the fact that the oracle needs to keep
track of exponentially many gold-standard derivations, which is solved
by integrating a packed parse forest with the beam-search decoder. Standard
CCGBank tests show the model achieves up to 1.05 labeled F-score
improvements over three existing, competitive CCG parsing models.
