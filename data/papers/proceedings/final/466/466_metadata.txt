Abstract#==#Much of the recent work on dependency parsing has been focused on solving
inherent combinatorial problems associated with rich scoring functions. In
contrast, we demonstrate that highly expressive scoring functions can be used
with substantially simpler inference procedures. Specifically, we introduce a
sampling-based parser that can easily handle arbitrary global features.
Inspired by SampleRank, we learn to take guided stochastic steps towards a high
scoring parse. We introduce two samplers for traversing the space of trees,
Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings with Random Walk. The model outperforms
state-of-the-art results when evaluated on 14 languages of non-projective CoNLL
datasets. Our sampling-based approach naturally extends to joint prediction
scenarios, such as joint parsing and POS correction. The resulting method
outperforms the best reported results on the CATiB dataset, approaching
performance of parsing with gold tags.
