Abstract#==#We investigate whether parsers can be used for self-monitoring in
  surface realization in order to avoid egregious errors involving
  "vicious" ambiguities, namely those where the intended
  interpretation fails to be considerably more likely than alternative
  ones.  Using parse accuracy in a simple reranking strategy for
  self-monitoring, we find that with a state-of-the-art averaged
  perceptron realization ranking model, BLEU scores cannot be improved
  with any of the well-known Treebank parsers we tested, since these
  parsers too often make errors that human readers would be unlikely
  to make.  However, by using an SVM ranker to combine the realizer's
  model score together with features from multiple parsers, including
  ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes, we
  show that significant increases in BLEU scores can be achieved.
  Moreover, via a targeted manual analysis, we demonstrate that the
  SVM reranker frequently manages to avoid vicious ambiguities, while
  its ranking errors tend to affect fluency much more often than
  adequacy.
