Abstract#==#We introduce a novel approach for building language models based on a
systematic, recursive exploration of skip $n$-gram models which are
interpolated using modified Kneser Ney smoothing.
Our approach generalizes language models as it contains the classical
interpolation with lower order models as a special case.
In this paper we motivate, formalize and present our approach.
In an extensive empirical experiment we demonstrate that our generalized
language models lead to a substantial reduction of perplexity between 3.1% and
12.7% in comparison to traditional language models using modified Kneser Ney
smoothing.
Furthermore, we investigate the behaviour over three other languages and a
domain specific corpus where we observed consistent improvements.
Finally, we also show that the strength of our approach lies in its ability to
cope in particular with sparse training data.
Using a very small training data set of only 736 KB text we yield improvements
of even 25.7% reduction of perplexity.
