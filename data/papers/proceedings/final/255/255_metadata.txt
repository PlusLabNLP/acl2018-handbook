Abstract#==#Using distributional analysis methods to compute semantic proximity links
between words has become commonplace in NLP. 
The resulting relations  are often noisy or difficult to interpret in general. 
This paper focuses on the issues of evaluating a distributional resource and
filtering 
the relations it contains, but instead of considering it in abstracto, we focus
on pairs of words in context. 
In a discourse, we are interested in knowing if the semantic link between two
items is
a by-product of textual coherence or is irrelevant.  
We first set up a human annotation of semantic links with or without contextual
information to show the importance
of the textual context in evaluating the relevance of semantic similarity, and
to assess the prevalence of actual semantic
relations between word tokens. We then built an experiment to automatically
predict this relevance, evaluated on the reliable reference data set which was
the outcome of the first annotation.  
We show that in-document information greatly improve the prediction made by the
similarity level alone.
