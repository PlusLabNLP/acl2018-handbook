Abstract#==#Negation words, such as no and not, play a fundamental role in modifying
sentiment of textual expressions. We will refer to a negation word as the
negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument.
Commonly used heuristics to estimate the sentiment of negated expressions rely
simply on the sentiment of argument (and not on the negator or the argument
itself). We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics
are poor estimators of sentiment. We then modify these heuristics to be
dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction. Next, we
evaluate a recently proposed composition model (Socher et al., 2013) that
relies on both the negator and the argument. This model learns the syntax and
semantics of the negatorâ€™s argument with a recursive neural network. We show
that this approach performs better than those mentioned above. Finally, we
explicitly incorporate the prior sentiment of the argument and observe that
this information can help further reduce fitting errors.
