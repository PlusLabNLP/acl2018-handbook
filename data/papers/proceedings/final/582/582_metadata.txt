Abstract#==#This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the
level of individual sentences. Most existing machine learning approaches suffer
from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across
sentences and often fail to capture non-local contextual cues that are
important for sentiment interpretation. In contrast, our approach allows
structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and
global contextual information. Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and
discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the
learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization. The
context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can
guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited. Experiments on
standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings.
