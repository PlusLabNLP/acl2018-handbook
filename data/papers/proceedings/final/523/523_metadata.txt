Abstract#==#Topic models, an unsupervised technique for inferring translation domains
improve
machine translation quality. However, previous work uses only the source
language
and completely ignores the target language, which can disambiguate domains. We
propose new polylingual tree-based topic models to extract domain knowledge
that considers both source and target languages and derive three different
inference schemes. We evaluate our model on a Chinese to English translation
task and obtain up to 1.2 BLEU improvement over strong baselines.
