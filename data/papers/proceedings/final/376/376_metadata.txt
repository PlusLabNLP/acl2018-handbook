Abstract#==#Recent work on Chinese analysis has led to large-scale annotations of the
internal structures of words, enabling character-level analysis of Chinese
syntactic structures.
In this paper, we investigate the problem of character-level Chinese dependency
parsing, building dependency trees over characters.
Character-level information can benefit downstream applications by offering
flexible granularities for word segmentation while improving word-level
dependency parsing accuracies.
We present novel adaptations of two major shift-reduce dependency parsing
algorithms to character-level parsing.
Experimental results on the Chinese Treebank demonstrate improved performances
over word-based parsing methods.
