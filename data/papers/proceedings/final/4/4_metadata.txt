Abstract#==#The essence of distantly supervised relation extraction is that it is an
incomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features.
To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the
classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of
minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown
labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates
training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic
framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and
item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover
the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix.
The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation
(FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely
used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that
our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline
and the state-of-the-art methods.
