Abstract#==#A typical knowledge-based question answering(KB-QA) system faces two
challenges: one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning
representations(MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases
(KBs) using generated MRs. Unlike previous methods which treat them in a
cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two
tasks in one unified framework. We translate questions to answers based on CYK
parsing. Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are
obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple
queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation
expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries
generated. A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate
training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer
pairs. Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our
method achieves better results.
