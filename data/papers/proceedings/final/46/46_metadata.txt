Abstract#==#We present an incremental joint frame- work to simultaneously extract entity
mentions and relations using structured perceptron with efficient beam-search.
A segment-based decoder based on the idea of semi-Markov chain is adopted to
the new framework as opposed to traditional token-based tagging. In addition,
by virtue of the inexact search, we developed a number of new and effective
global features as soft constraints to capture the inter- dependency among
entity mentions and relations. Experiments on Automatic Content Extraction
(ACE) corpora demonstrate that our joint model significantly outperforms a
strong pipelined baseline, which attains better performance than the
best-reported end-to-end system.
