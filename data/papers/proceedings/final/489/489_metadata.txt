Abstract#==#We introduce ConnotationWordNet, a connotation lexicon over the network of
words in conjunction with senses. We formulate the lexicon induction problem as
collective inference over pairwise-Markov Random Fields, and present a loopy
belief propagation algorithm for inference. The key aspect of our method is
that it is the first unified approach that assigns the polarity of both word-
and sense-level connotations, exploiting the innate bipartite graph structure
encoded in WordNet. We present comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate the
quality and utility of the resulting lexicon in comparison to existing
connotation and sentiment lexicons.
