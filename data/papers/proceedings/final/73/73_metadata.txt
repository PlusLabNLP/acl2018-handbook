Abstract#==#Previous researches on Text-level discourse parsing mainly made use of
constituency structure to parse the whole document into one discourse tree. In
this paper, we present the limitations of constituency based discourse parsing
and first propose to use dependency structure to directly represent the
relations between elementary discourse units (EDUs). The state-of-the-art
dependency parsing techniques, the Eisner algorithm and maximum spanning tree
(MST) algorithm, are adopted to parse an optimal discourse dependency tree
based on the arc-factored model and the large-margin learning techniques.
Experiments show that our discourse dependency parsers achieve a competitive
performance on text-level discourse parsing.
