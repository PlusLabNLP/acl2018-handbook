Abstract#==#Bidirectional models of word alignment are an appealing alternative
  to post-hoc combinations of directional word
  aligners. Unfortunately, most formulations are NP-Hard to solve, and a
previous attempt to use a relaxation-based decoder
  yielded few exact solutions (6\%). We present a novel relaxation for
  decoding the bidirectional model of DeNero and Macherey. The relaxation can
be
  solved with a modified version of the Viterbi algorithm. To find
  optimal solutions on difficult instances, we alternate between
  incrementally adding constraints and applying optimality-preserving
  coarse-to-fine pruning. The algorithm finds exact solutions on $86$\%
  of sentence pairs and shows improvements over directional models.
