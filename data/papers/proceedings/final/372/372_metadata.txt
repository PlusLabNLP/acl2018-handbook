Abstract#==#Current multi-document summarization (MDS) systems have been designed for
short, unstructured summaries of 10-15 documents, and are inadequate for larger
document collections. We propose a new approach to scaling up summarization
called hierarchical summarization, and present the first implemented system,
Summa. 

Summa produces a hierarchy of relatively short summaries, where the top level
provides a general overview and  users can navigate the hierarchy to drill down
for more details on topics of interest.  Summa optimizes for coherence as well
as coverage of salient information.  In an Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation,
users prefer Summa ten times as often as flat MDS and three times as often as
timelines.
