Abstract#==#A central challenge in semantic parsing is handling the myriad ways in which
knowledge base predicates can be expressed. Traditionally, semantic parsers are
trained primarily from text paired with knowledge base information. Our goal is
to exploit the much larger amounts of raw text not tied to any knowledge base.
In this paper, we turn semantic parsing on its head. Given an input utterance,
we first use a simple method to deterministically generate a set of candidate
logical forms with a canonical realization in natural language for each. Then,
we use a paraphrase model to choose the realization that best paraphrases the
input, and output the corresponding logical form. We present two simple
paraphrase models, an association model and a vector space model, and train
them jointly from question-answer pairs. Our system PARASEMPRE improves
state-of-the-art accuracies on two recently released question-answering
datasets.
