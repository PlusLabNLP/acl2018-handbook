Abstract#==#We propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn
semantic phrase embeddings (compact vector representations for phrases), which
can distinguish the phrases with different semantic meanings.
The BRAE is trained in a way that minimizes the semantic distance of
translation equivalents and maximizes the semantic distance of non-translation
pairs simultaneously.
After training, the model learns how to embed each phrase semantically in two
languages and also learns how to transform semantic embedding space in one
language to the other. 
We evaluate our proposed method on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table
pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to measure
semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates.
Extensive experiments show that the BRAE is remarkably effective in these two
tasks.
