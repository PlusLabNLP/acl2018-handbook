Abstract#==#The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based
on the implicit hypothesis that corpora are balanced. However, the historical
context-based projection method dedicated to this task is relatively
insensitive to the sizes of each part of the comparable corpus. Within this
context, we have carried out a study on the influence of unbalanced specialized
comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through
different experiments. Moreover, we have introduced a regression model that
boosts the observations of word co-occurrences used in the context-based
projection method. Our results show that the use of unbalanced specialized
comparable corpora induces a significant gain in the quality of extracted
lexicons.
