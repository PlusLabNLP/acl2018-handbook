Abstract#==#Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) is a framework of natural
language semantics with easy-to-process structures as well as strict semantics.
In this paper, we equip the DCS framework with logical inference, by defining
abstract denotations as an abstraction of the computing process of denotations
in original DCS. An inference engine is built to achieve inference on abstract
denotations. Furthermore, we propose a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge in
logical inference, by combining our framework with the idea of tree
transformation. Experiments on FraCaS and PASCAL RTE datasets show promising
results.
