Abstract#==#Morphological segmentation is an effective sparsity reduction strategy for
statistical machine translation (SMT) involving morphologically complex
languages. When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is
required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best
output from the de- coder. In this paper, we expand our translation options by
desegmenting n-best lists or lattices. Our novel lattice desegmentation
algorithm gives us access to both segmented and desegmented views of the target
language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs. This allows us
to include features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an
unsegmented language model (LM), to help select the best translation. We
investigate this technique in the context of English-to-Arabic and
English-to-Finnish translation, showing significant improvements over
desegmentation of 1-best decoder outputs.
