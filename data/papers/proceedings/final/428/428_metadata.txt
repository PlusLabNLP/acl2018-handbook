Abstract#==#We introduce a provably correct learning algorithm for latent-variable PCFGs.
The algorithm relies on two steps: first, the use of a matrix-decomposition
algorithm applied to a co-occurrence matrix estimated from the parse trees in a
training sample; second, the use of EM applied to a convex objective derived
from the training samples in combination with the output from the matrix
decomposition. Experiments on parsing and a language modeling problem show that
the algorithm is efficient and effective in practice.
