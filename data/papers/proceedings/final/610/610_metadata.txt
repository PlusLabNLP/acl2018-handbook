Abstract#==#We present a series of algorithms with theoretical guarantees for learning
accurate ensembles of several structured prediction rules for which no prior
knowledge is assumed. This includes a number of randomized and deterministic
algorithms devised by converting on-line learning algorithms to batch ones, and
a boosting-style algorithm applicable in the context of structured prediction
with a large number of labels. We also report the results of extensive
experiments with these algorithms.
