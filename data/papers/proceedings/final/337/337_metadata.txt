Abstract#==#Large-scale knowledge bases are important assets in NLP. Frequently, such
resources are constructed through automatic mergers of complementary resources,
such as WordNet and Wikipedia. However, manually validating these resources is
prohibitively expensive, even when using methods such as crowdsourcing. We
propose a cost-effective method of validating and extending knowledge bases
using video games with a purpose. Two video games were created to validate
concept-concept and concept-image relations. In experiments comparing
with crowdsourcing, we show that video game-based validation consistently leads
to higher-quality annotations, even when players are not compensated.
