Abstract#==#Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) is a recently developed framework for
probabilistic logic. We use PSL to combine logical and distributional
representations of natural-language meaning, where distributional information
is represented in the form of weighted inference rules. We apply this framework
to the task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) (i.e. judging the semantic
similarity of natural language sentences), and show that PSL gives improved
results compared to a previous approach based on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)
and a purely distributional approach.
