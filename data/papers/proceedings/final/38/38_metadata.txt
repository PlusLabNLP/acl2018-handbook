Abstract#==#Distributional semantic methods to approximate word meaning with context
vectors have been very successful empirically, and the last years have seen a
surge of interest in their compositional extension to phrases and sentences. We
present here a new model that, like those of Coecke et al. (2010) and Baroni
and Zamparelli (2010), closely mimics the standard Montagovian semantic
treatment of composition in distributional terms. However, our approach avoids
a number of issues that have prevented the application of the earlier
linguistically-motivated models to full-fledged, real-life sentences. We test
the model on a variety of empirical tasks, showing that it consistently
outperforms a set of competitive rivals.
