Abstract#==#A key challenge for computational models of
conversation is to discover latent structure in
dialogue. This is particularly true for task-oriented dialogues, where the
latent structure
provides a basis for analysing, evaluating, and
building conversational systems. In this paper, we propose three new
unsupervised dialogue models to discover latent structures in
task-oriented dialogues. Our methods synthesize hidden Markov models (for
underlying
state) and topic models (to connect words to
states). We apply our models to two corpora of
real, non-trivial dialogues: human-computer
spoken dialogues in the bus timetable domain,
and human-human text-based web chats from
a live technical support service. Qualitatively,
we show that our models extract meaningful
state representations and dialogue structures
consistent with human annotations. Quantitatively, we evaluate using log
likelihood and an
ordering task on a held-out test set. We show
that our models advance the state-of-the-art on
both metrics, on both datasets.
