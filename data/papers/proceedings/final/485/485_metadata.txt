Abstract#==#We propose an online learning algorithm based on tensor-space models. A
tensor-space model represents data in a compact way, and via rank-1
approximation the weight tensor can be made highly structured hence the number
of parameters to be estimated is significantly smaller than the traditional
vector-space models. This regularizes the model complexity and makes the tensor
model highly effective under situations where a large feature set is defined
but very low resource is available for training. We experimented the proposed
algorithm on a parsing task, and our results show that even with very little
training data the learning algorithm based on tensor model performs well, and
gives significantly better results than learning algorithms based on
traditional vector-space models.
