Abstract#==#This study investigates on building a better Chinese word segmentation model
for statistical machine translation. It aims at leveraging word boundary
information, automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments, to
induce a preferable segmentation model. We propose dealing with the induced
word boundaries as soft constraints to bias the continuous learning of a
supervised CRFs model, trained by the treebank data (labeled), on the bilingual
data (unlabeled). The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph
propagation constraint. The constrained model induction is accomplished by
using posterior regularization algorithm. The experiments on a
Chinese-to-English machine translation task reveal that the proposed model can
bring positive segmentation effects to translation quality.
