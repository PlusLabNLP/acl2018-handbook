Abstract#==#Extracting opinion targets and opinion words from online reviews are two
fundamental tasks in opinion mining. This paper proposes a novel approach to
collectively extract them with graph co-ranking. First, compared to previous
methods which solely employed opinion relations among words, our method
constructs a heterogeneous graph to model two types of relations, including
semantic relations and opinion relations. Next, a co-ranking algorithm is
proposed to estimate the confidence of each candidate, and the candidates with
higher confidence will be extracted as opinion targets/words. In this way,
different relations make cooperative effects on confidence estimation of each
candidate. Moreover, word preference is captured and incorporated into our
co-ranking algorithm. In this way, our co-ranking is personalized and each
candidate confidence is only determined by their preferred collocations, which
helps to improve the extraction precision. The experimental results on three
data sets with different sizes and languages show that our approach achieves
better performance than state-of-the-art methods.
