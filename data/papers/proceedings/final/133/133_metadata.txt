Abstract#==#Designing measures that capture various aspects of language ability is a
central task in the design of systems for automatic scoring of spontaneous
speech. In this study, we address a key aspect of language proficiency
assessment -- syntactic complexity.  We propose a novel measure of syntactic
complexity for spontaneous speech that shows optimum empirical performance on
real world data in multiple ways. First, it is both {\it robust} and {\it
reliable}, producing  automatic scores                                               
     

that
agree well
with
human
rating
compared to the state-of-the-art.  Second, the measure makes sense
theoretically, both from algorithmic and native language acquisition points of
view.
