Abstract#==#We propose a robust answer reranking model for non-factoid questions that
integrates lexical semantics with discourse information, driven by two
representations of discourse: a shallow representation centered around
discourse markers, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. We
evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains:
one from Yahoo! Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of
non-factoid questions: manner and reason. We experimentally demonstrate that
the discourse structure of non-factoid answers provides information that is
complementary to lexical semantic similarity between question and answer,
improving performance up to 24% (relative) over a state-of-the-art model that
exploits lexical semantic similarity alone. We further demonstrate excellent
domain transfer of discourse information, suggesting these discourse features
have general utility to non-factoid question answering.
