Abstract#==#We present an adaptive translation quality estimation (QE) method to predict
the human-targeted translation error rate (HTER) for a document-specific
machine translation model. We first introduce features derived internal to the
translation decoding process as well as externally from the source sentence
analysis. We show the effectiveness of such features in both classification and
regression of MT quality. By dynamically training the QE model for the
document-specific MT model, we are able to achieve consistency and prediction
quality across multiple documents, demonstrated by the higher correlation co-
efficient and F-scores in finding Good sentences. Additionally, the proposed
method is applied to IBM English-to-Japanese MT post editing field study and we
observe strong correlation with human preference, with a 10% increase in human
translatorsâ€™ productivity.
