Abstract#==#We present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which combines
deep semantics and monolingual machine translation to derive simple
sentences from complex ones. The approach differs from previous work
in two main ways. First, it is semantic based in that it takes as
input a deep semantic representation rather than e.g., a sentence or a
parse tree. Second, it combines a simplification model for splitting
and deletion with a monolingual translation model for phrase
substitution and reordering. When compared against current state of
the art methods, our model yields significantly simpler output that is
both grammatical and meaning preserving.
