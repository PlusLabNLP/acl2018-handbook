Abstract#==#We present a novel approach for automatic
report generation from time-series data, in
the context of student feedback generation.
Our proposed methodology treats
content selection as a multi-label (ML)
classification problem, which takes as input
time-series data and outputs a set of
templates, while capturing the dependencies
between selected templates. We show
that this method generates output closer to
the feedback that lecturers actually generated,
achieving 3.5% higher accuracy and
15% higher F-score than multiple simple
classifiers that keep a history of selected
templates. Furthermore, we compare a
ML classifier with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) approach in simulation and using
ratings from real student users. We show
that the different methods have different
benefits, with ML being more accurate for
predicting what was seen in the training
data, whereas RL is more exploratory and
slightly preferred by the students.
