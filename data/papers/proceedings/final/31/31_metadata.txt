Abstract#==#We propose a two-phase framework to adapt existing relation extraction
classifiers to extract relations for new target domains.
We address two challenges:
negative transfer when knowledge in source domains is used without considering
the differences in relation distributions;
and lack of adequate labeled samples for rarer relations in the new domain, due
to a small labeled data set and imbalance relation distributions.
Our framework leverages on both labeled and unlabeled data in the target
domain.
First, we determine the relevance of each source domain to the target domain
for each relation type, using the consistency between the clustering given by
the target domain labels and the clustering given by the predictors trained for
the source domain.
To overcome the lack of labeled samples for rarer relations, these clusterings
operate on both the labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain.
Second, we trade-off between using relevance-weighted source-domain predictors
and the labeled target data.
Again, to overcome the imbalance distribution, the source-domain predictors
operate on the unlabeled target data.
Our  method  outperforms numerous baselines and a weakly-supervised relation
extraction method on ACE 2004 and YAGO.
