Abstract#==#The automatic estimation of machine translation (MT) output quality is a hard
task in which the selection of the appropriate algorithm and the most
predictive features over reasonably sized training sets plays a crucial role.
When moving from controlled lab evaluations to real-life scenarios the task
becomes even harder. For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional
complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes. The
instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different
distributions, in fact, calls for adaptive solutions that react to new
operating conditions. To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for
adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes.
Contrastive experiments in different testing conditions involving user and
domain changes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
