Abstract#==#We explore the extent to which high-resource manual annotations 
    such as treebanks  
    are necessary for the task of semantic role labeling (SRL).
    We examine how performance changes without syntactic supervision, 
    comparing both joint and pipelined
    methods to induce latent syntax.  
    This work highlights a new 
   application of unsupervised grammar induction and demonstrates 
    several approaches to SRL in the absence of supervised syntax.
    Our best models obtain competitive results in the 
    high-resource setting and state-of-the-art results in the low 
    resource setting, reaching 72.48% F1 averaged across languages.  
    We release our code for this work along with a larger toolkit for
specifying arbitrary 
    graphical structure.
