Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-
phase approach. The first phase learns representations that capture
regularities underlying web text. The representation is integrated as features
into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger.
Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the
second phase. Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach
achieves 93.27% average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported
so
far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.
