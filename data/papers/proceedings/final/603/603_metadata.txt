Abstract#==#We propose a supervised method of
extracting event causalities like "conduct
slash-and-burn agriculture" -> "exacerbate
desertification" from the web using semantic
relation (between nouns), context,
and association features. Experiments
show that our method outperforms baselines
that are based on state-of-the-art
methods. We also propose methods of
generating future scenarios like "conduct
slash-and-burn agriculture" -> "exacerbate
desertification" -> "increase Asian dust (from
China)" -> "asthma gets worse". Experiments
show that we can generate 50,000
scenarios with 68% precision. We also
generated a scenario "deforestation continues"
 -> "global warming worsens" -> "sea
temperatures rise" -> "vibrio parahaemolyticus
fouls (water)", which is written in no
document in our input web corpus crawled
in 2007. But the vibrio risk due to global
warming was observed in Baker-Austin
et al. (2013). Thus, we “predicted” the
future event sequence in a sense.
