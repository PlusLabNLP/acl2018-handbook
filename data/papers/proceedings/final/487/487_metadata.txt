Abstract#==#Crowdsourcing is a viable mechanism for creating training data for machine
translation. It provides a low cost, fast turnaround way of processing large
volumes of data. However, when compared to professional translation, naive
collection of translations from non-professionals yields low-quality results.
Careful quality control is necessary for crowdsourcing to work well. In this
paper, we examine the challenges of a two-step collaboration process with
translation and post-editing by non-professionals. We develop graph-based
ranking models that automatically select the best output from multiple
redundant versions of translations and edits, and improves translation quality
closer to professionals.
