Abstract#==#While user attribute extraction on social media has received considerable
research attention, existing approaches, mostly supervised, encounter great
difficulty in
obtaining gold standards, thus usually narrowed to trivial domains where ground
truth is easy to identify (e.g., gender). In this paper, we present a
weakly-supervised approach to for user profile extraction from Twitter.  Users'
profiles from social media websites such as Facebook or Google Plus are used as
a distant source of supervision for extraction of their attributes from
user-generated text.  In addition to traditional linguistic features used in
distant supervision for information extraction, our approach also takes into
account network information, 
a unique opportunity offered by social media.  We test our algorithm on three
attribute domains: spouse, education and job; experimental results demonstrate 
our approach is able to make accurate predictions for users' attributes based
on their tweets.
