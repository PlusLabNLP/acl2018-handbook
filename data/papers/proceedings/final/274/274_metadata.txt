Abstract#==#This paper introduces FactChecker, a
novel, language-aware approach to truth-finding.
FactChecker differs from prior
approaches in that it does not rely on iterative
peer voting, instead it leverages language
to infer believability of fact candidates.
In particular, FactChecker makes
use of linguistic features to detect if a
given source objectively states facts or
is speculative and opinionated. To ensure
that fact candidates mentioned in
similar sources have similar believability,
FactChecker augments objectivity with a
co-mention score to compute the overall
believability score of a fact candidate. Our
experiments on various datasets show that
FactChecker yields higher accuracy than
existing approaches.
