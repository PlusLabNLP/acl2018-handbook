Abstract#==#In order to extract entities of a fine-grained category from semi-structured
data in web pages, existing information extraction systems rely on seed
examples or redundancy across multiple web pages. In this paper, we consider a
new zero-shot learning task of extracting entities specified by a natural
language query (in place of seeds) given only a single web page. Our approach
defines a log-linear model over latent extraction predicates, which select
lists of entities from the web page. The main challenge is to define features
on widely varying candidate entity lists. We tackle this by abstracting list
elements and using aggregate statistics to define features. Finally, we created
a new dataset of diverse queries and web pages, and show that our system
achieves significantly better accuracy than a natural baseline.
