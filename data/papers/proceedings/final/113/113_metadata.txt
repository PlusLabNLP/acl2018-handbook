Abstract#==#We present a method that learns word embedding for Twitter sentiment
classification in this paper. Most existing algorithms for learning continuous
word representations typically model only the syntactic context of words but
ignore the sentiment of text. This is problematic for sentiment analysis as
they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment
polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors. We address this
issue by learning sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes
sentiment information in the continuous representation of words. Specifically,
we develop three neural network architectures to effectively incorporate the
supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their
loss functions. To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the
sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets
collected by positive and negative emoticons. Experiments on applying SSWE to a
benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that
(1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the
top-performed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating
SSWE with existing feature set.
