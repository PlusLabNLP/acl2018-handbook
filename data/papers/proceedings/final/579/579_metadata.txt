Abstract#==#We present a novel way of generating unseen words, which is useful for certain
applications such as automatic speech recognition or optical character
recognition in low-resource languages. We test our vocabulary generator on
seven low-resource languages by measuring the decrease in out-of-vocabulary
word rate on a held-out test set. The languages we study have very different
morphological properties; we show how our results differ depending on the
morphological complexity of the language. In our best result (on Assamese), our
approach can predict 29% of the token-based out-of-vocabulary with a small
amount of unlabeled training data.
