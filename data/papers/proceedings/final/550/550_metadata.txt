Abstract#==#Most existing relation extraction models make predictions for each entity pair
locally and individually, while ignoring implicit
global clues available in the knowledge base, sometimes leading to conflicts
among single predictions
from different entity pairs. In this paper, we propose a joint inference
framework that utilizes these global clues to resolve disagreements among
local predictions. 
We exploit two kinds of clues 
to generate constraints to capture the implicit type and cardinality
requirements of a relation.  
Experimental results on three datasets, in both English and Chinese,
show that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art relation exraction models when such clues are applicable to
the datasets.
And, we find that the clues learned automatically from existing knowledge bases
perform
comparably to those refined by human.
