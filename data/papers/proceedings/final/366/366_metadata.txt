is a challenging  task because the output typically obeys various global
constraints.  Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints, where the
model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially
improve segmentation performance. On the other hand, for imposing hard
constraints, dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction
given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference. We extend dual
decomposition
to perform prediction subject to soft constraints. Moreover, with a technique
for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically
generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple
convex optimization problem during training. This allows us to obtain
substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction
dataset.
