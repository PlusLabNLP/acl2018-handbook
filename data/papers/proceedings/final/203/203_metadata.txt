Abstract#==#The sense in which a word is used determines the translation of the word. In
this paper, we propose a sense-based translation model to integrate word senses
into statistical machine translation. We build a broad-coverage sense tagger
based on a nonparametric Bayesian topic model that automatically learns sense
clusters for words in the source language. The proposed sense-based translation
model enables the decoder to select appropriate translations for source words
according to the inferred senses for these words using maximum entropy
classifiers. Our method is significantly different from previous word sense
disambiguation reformulated for machine translation in that the latter neglects
word senses in nature. We test the effectiveness of the proposed sense-based
translation
model on a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. Results show that
the proposed model substantially outperforms not only the baseline but also the
previous reformulated word sense disambiguation.
