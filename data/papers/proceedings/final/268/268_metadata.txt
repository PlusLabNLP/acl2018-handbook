Abstract#==#Abstractive text summarization of news requires a way of representing events,
such as a collection of pattern clusters in which every cluster represents an
event (e.g., marriage) and every pattern in the cluster is a way of expressing
the event (e.g., X married Y, X and Y tied the knot). We compare three ways of
extracting event patterns: heuristics-based, compression-based and
memory-based. While the former has been used previously in multi-document
abstraction, the latter two have never been used for this task. Compared with
the first two techniques, the memory-based method allows for generating
significantly more grammatical and informative sentences, at the cost of
searching a vast space of hundreds of millions of parse trees of known
grammatical utterances. To this end, we introduce a data structure and a search
method that make it possible to efficiently extrapolate from every sentence the
parse sub-trees that match against any of the stored utterances.
