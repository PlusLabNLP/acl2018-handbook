Abstract#==#Analyses of filler-gap dependencies usually involve complex syntactic rules or
heuristics; however recent results suggest that filler-gap comprehension begins
earlier than seemingly simpler constructions such as ditransitives or passives.
Therefore, this work models filler-gap acquisition as a byproduct of learning
word orderings (e.g. SVO vs OSV), which must be done at a very young age anyway
in order to extract meaning from language. Specifically, this model, trained on
part-of-speech tags, represents the preferred locations of semantic roles
relative to a verb as Gaussian mixtures over real numbers.

This approach learns role assignment in filler-gap constructions in a manner
consistent with current developmental findings and is extremely robust to
initialization variance. Additionally, this model is shown to be able to
account for a characteristic error made by learners during this period ('A and
B gorped' interpreted as 'A gorped B').
