Abstract#==#Instructor intervention in student discussion forums is a vital component in
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where personalized interaction is limited.
This paper introduces the problem of predicting instructor interventions in
MOOC forums. We propose several prediction models designed to capture unique
aspects of MOOCs, combining course information, forum structure and posts
content. Our models abstract contents of individual posts of threads using
latent categories, learned jointly with the binary intervention prediction
problem. Experiments over data from two Coursera MOOCs demonstrate that
incorporating the structure of threads into the learning problem leads to
better predictive performance.
