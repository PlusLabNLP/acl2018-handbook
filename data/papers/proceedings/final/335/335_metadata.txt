Abstract#==#We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving
machine translation evaluation. We first design two
discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree
kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the
Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures
can help improve a number of existing machine translation
evaluation metrics both at the segment- and at the system-level.
Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that
discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art
evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the
development of future richer evaluation metrics.
