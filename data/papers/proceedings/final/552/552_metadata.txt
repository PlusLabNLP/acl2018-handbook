Abstract#==#An individual's words often reveal their political ideology. Existing
automated techniques to identify ideology from text focus on bags of
words or wordlists, ignoring syntax. Taking inspiration from recent work in
sentiment analysis that successfully models the compositional aspect of
language, we apply a recursive neural network (RNN) framework to the
task of identifying the political position evinced by a sentence. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with additional subsentential
elements, we crowdsource political annotations at a phrase and sentence level.
We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models on our new dataset
and an existing dataset.
