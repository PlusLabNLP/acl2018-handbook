Abstract#==#We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance
multi-document summarization. We employ a fully automated temporal processing
system to generate a timeline for each input document. We derive three features
from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead
to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art
baseline. In addition, we propose TIMEMMR, a modification to Maximal Marginal
Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of computing time span
similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets. We also
propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our
automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization. By
selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization
performance is increased by a significant 5.9%.
