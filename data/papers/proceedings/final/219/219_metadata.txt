Abstract#==#Active learning (AL) has been proven effective to reduce human annotation
efforts in NLP. However, previous studies on AL are limited to applications in
a single language. This paper proposes a bilingual active learning paradigm for
relation classification, where the unlabeled instances are first jointly chosen
in terms of their prediction uncertainty scores in two languages and then
manually labeled by an oracle. Instead of using a parallel corpus, labeled and
unlabeled instances in one language are translated into ones in the other
language and all instances in both languages are then fed into a bilingual
active learning engine as pseudo parallel corpora. Experimental results on the
ACE RDC 2005 Chinese and English corpora show that bilingual active learning
for relation classification significantly outperforms monolingual active
learning.
