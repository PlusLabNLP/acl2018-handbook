Abstract#==#Product feature mining is a key subtask in fine-grained opinion mining.
Previous works often use syntax constituents in this task. However,
syntax-based methods can only use discrete contextual information, which may
suffer from data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel product feature mining
method which leverages lexical and contextual semantic clues. Lexical semantic
clue verifies whether a candidate term is related to the target product, and
contextual semantic clue serves as a soft pattern miner to find candidates,
which exploits semantics of each word in context so as to alleviate the data
sparsity problem. We build a semantic similarity graph to encode lexical
semantic clue, and employ a convolutional neural model to capture contextual
semantic clue. Then Label Propagation is applied to combine both semantic
clues. Experimental results show that our semantics-based method significantly
outperforms conventional syntax-based approaches, which not only mines product
features more accurately, but also extracts more infrequent product features.
