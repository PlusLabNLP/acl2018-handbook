Abstract#==#Spectral methods offer scalable alternatives
to Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation
maximization. However, these new
methods lack the rich priors associated with
probabilistic models. We examine Arora et
al.â€™s anchor words algorithm for topic modeling
and develop new, regularized algorithms
that not only mathematically resemble
Gaussian and Dirichlet priors but also
improve the interpretability of topic models.
Our new regularization approaches make
these efficient algorithms more flexible; we
also show that these methods can be combined
with informed priors.
