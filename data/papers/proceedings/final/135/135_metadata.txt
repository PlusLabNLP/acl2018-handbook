Abstract#==#Learning phonetic categories is one of the first steps to learning a
language, yet is hard to do using only distributional phonetic
information.  Semantics could potentially be useful, since words with
different meanings have distinct phonetics, but it is unclear how many
word meanings are known to infants learning phonetic categories.  We
show that attending to a weaker source of semantics, in the form of a
distribution over topics in the current context, can lead to
improvements in phonetic category learning.  In our model, an extension
of a previous model of joint word-form and phonetic category inference,
the probability of word-forms is topic-dependent, enabling the model to
find significantly better phonetic vowel categories and word-forms than
a model with no semantic knowledge.
