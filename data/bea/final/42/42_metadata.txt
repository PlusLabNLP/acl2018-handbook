Abstract#==#Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is concerned with correcting grammatical errors in written text. Current GEC systems, namely those leveraging statistical and neural machine translation, require large quantities of annotated training data, which can be expensive or impractical to obtain. This research compares techniques for generating synthetic data utilized by the two highest scoring submissions
to the restricted and low-resource tracks in the BEA-2019 Shared Task on Grammatical Error
Correction.
