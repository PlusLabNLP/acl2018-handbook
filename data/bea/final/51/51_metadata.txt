Abstract#==#Complex Word Identification (CWI) is a task for the identification of words that are challenging for second-language learners to read. 
Even though the use of neural classifiers is now common in CWI, the interpretation of their parameters remains difficult. 
This paper analyzes neural CWI classifiers and shows that some of their parameters can be interpreted as vocabulary size.
We present a novel formalization of vocabulary size measurement methods that are practiced in the applied linguistics field as a kind of neural classifier.
We also contribute to building a novel dataset for validating vocabulary testing and readability via crowdsourcing.
