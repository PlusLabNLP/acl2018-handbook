Abstract#==#Our research investigation focuses on the role of humans in supplying corrected
examples in active learning cycles, an important aspect of deploying active
learning in practice.  In this paper, we dis-cuss sampling strategies and
sampling sizes in set-ting up an active learning system for human ex-periments
in the task of content analysis, which involves labeling concepts in large
volumes of text.  The cost of conducting comprehensive hu-man subject studies
to experimentally determine the effects of sampling sizes and sampling sizes is
high. To reduce those costs, we first applied an active learning simulation
approach to test the ef-fect of different sampling strategies and sampling
sizes on machine learning (ML) performance in order to select a smaller set of
parameters to be evaluated in human subject studies.
