Abstract#==#This paper aims to provide an effective interface for progressive refinement of
pattern-based information extraction systems. Pattern-based information
extraction (IE) systems have an advantage over machine learning based systems
that patterns are easy to customize to cope with errors and are interpretable
by humans. Building a pattern-based system is usually an iterative process of
trying different parameters and thresholds to learn patterns and entities with
high precision and recall. Since patterns are interpretable to humans, it is
possible to identify sources of errors, such as patterns responsible for
extracting incorrect entities and vice-versa, and correct them. However, it
involves time consuming manual inspection of the extracted output. We present a
light-weight tool, SPIED, to aid IE system developers in learning entities
using patterns with bootstrapping, and visualizing the learned entities and
patterns with explanations. SPIED is the first publicly available tool to
visualize diagnostic information of multiple pattern learning systems to the
best of our knowledge.
