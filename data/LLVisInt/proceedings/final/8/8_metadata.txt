Abstract#==#The wordcloud is a ubiquitous visualization of human language, though it falls
short when used for exploratory data analysis. To address some of these
shortcomings, we give the viewer explicit control over the creation of the
wordcloud, allowing them to interact with it in real time -  a dynamic
wordcloud. This allows iterative adaptation of the visualization to the data
and inference task at hand. We next present a principled approach to
visualization which highlights the similarities and differences between two
sets of documents â€“ a Venncloud. We make all the visualization code
(primarily JavaScript) freely available.
