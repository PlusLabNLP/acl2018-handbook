Abstract#==#Existing algorithms for understanding large collections of documents often
produce output that is nearly as difficult and time consuming to interpret as
reading each of the documents themselves. Topic modeling is a text
understanding algorithm that discovers the "topics" or themes within a
collection of documents. Tools based on topic modeling become increasingly
complex as the number of topics required to best represent the collection
increases. In this work, we present Hierarchie, an interactive visualization
that adds structure to large topic models, making them approachable and useful
to an end user. Additionally, we demonstrate Hierarchie's utility in analysis
of a diverse document set regarding a currently trending news topic.
