Abstract#==#Analysis tools based on topic models are often used as a means to explore large
amounts of unstructured data. Users often reason about the correctness of a
model using relationship between words within the topics or topics within the
model. We compute this useful contextual information as term co-occurrence and
topic covariance and overlay it on top of standard topic model output via an
intuitive interactive visualizations. This is a work in progress with the end
goal to combine the visual representation with interactions and online
learning, so the users can directly explore (a) why a model may not align with
their intuition and (b) modify the model as needed.
