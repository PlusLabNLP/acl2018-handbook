Abstract#==#We present an interactive text to 3D scene generation system that learns the
expected spatial layout of objects from data.  A user provides input natural
language text from which we extract explicit constraints on the objects that
should appear in the scene.  Given these explicit constraints, the system then
uses prior observations of spatial arrangements in a database of scenes to
infer the most likely layout of the objects in the scene.  Through further user
interaction, the system gradually adjusts and improves its estimates of where
objects should be placed.  We present example generated scenes and user
interaction scenarios.
