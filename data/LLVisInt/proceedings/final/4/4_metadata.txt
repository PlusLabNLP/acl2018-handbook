Abstract#==#Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a topic modeling tool that  automatically
discovers topics from a large collection of documents. It  is one of the most
popular text analysis tools currently in use. In practice however, the topics
discovered by LDA don't always make sense to end users. In this extended
abstract, we propose an active learning framework that                               
interactively and
iteratively acquires user feedback to improve the quality of learned topics. We
conduct experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness with simulated user input
on a benchmark dataset.
