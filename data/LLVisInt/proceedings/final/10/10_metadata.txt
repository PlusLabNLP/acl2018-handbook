Abstract#==#Exploring an online conversation can be very difficult for a user, especially
when it becomes a long complex thread. We follow a human-centered design
approach to  tightly integrate text mining methods with interactive
visualization techniques to support the users in fulfilling their information
needs. The resulting visual text analytic system provides multifaceted
exploration of asynchronous conversations. We discuss a number of open
challenges and possible directions for further improvement including the
integration of interactive human feedback in the text mining loop, applying
more advanced text analysis methods with visualization techniques, and
evaluating the system with real users.
