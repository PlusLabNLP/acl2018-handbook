Abstract#==#Facilitating vocabulary knowledge is a challenging aspect for language
learners. Although current corpus-based reference tools provide authentic
contextual clues, the plain text format is not conducive to fully illustrating
some lexical phenomena. Thus, this paper proposes GLANCE , a text visualization
tool, to present a large amount of lexical phenomena using charts and graphs,
aimed at helping language learners understand a word quickly and intuitively.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed interfaces to allow
comparison between text and graphics presentation, and conducted a preliminary
user study with ESL students. The results show that the visualized display is
of greater benefit to the understanding of word characteristics than textual
display.
