Abstract#==#We present LDAvis, a web-based interactive visualization of topics estimated
using Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is built using a combination of R and
D3. Our visualization provides a global view of the topics (and how they differ
from each other), while at the same time allowing for a deep inspection of the
terms most highly associated with each individual topic. First, we propose a
novel method for choosing which terms to present to a user to aid in the task
of topic interpretation, in which we define the relevance of a term to a topic.
Second, we present results from a user study that suggest that ranking terms
purely by their probability under a topic is suboptimal for topic
interpretation. Last, we describe LDAvis, our visualization system that allows
users to flexibly explore topic-term relationships using relevance to better
understand a fitted LDA model.
