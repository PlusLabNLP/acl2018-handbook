Abstract#==#In this paper I describe a preliminary experimental system, MITextExplorer, for
textual linked brushing, which allows an analyst to interactively explore
statistical relationships between (1) terms, and (2) document metadata
(covariates).  An analyst can graphically select documents embedded in a
temporal, spatial, or other continuous space, and the tool reports terms with
strong statistical associations for the region.  The user can then drill down
to specific term and term groupings, viewing further associations, and see how
terms are used in context.  The goal is to rapidly compare language usage
across interesting document covariates.

I illustrate examples of using the tool on several datasets: geo-located
Twitter messages, presidential State of the Union addresses, the ACL Anthology,
and the King James Bible.
