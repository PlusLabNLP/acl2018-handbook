Abstract#==#In the field of factoid question answering (QA), it is known that the
 state-of-the-art technology has achieved an accuracy comparable to that
 of humans in a certain benchmark challenge.  On the other hand, in the
 area of non-factoid QA, there is still a limited number of datasets for
 training QA models, i.e., machine comprehension models.  Considering
 such a situation within the field of the non-factoid QA, this paper
 aims to develop a dataset for training Japanese how-to tip QA models.  This
 paper applies one of the state-of-the-art machine comprehension models
 to the Japanese how-to tip QA dataset. The trained how-to tip QA model is also
 compared with a factoid QA model trained with a Japanese factoid QA
 dataset. Evaluation results revealed that the how-to tip machine
 comprehension performance was almost comparative with that of the
 factoid machine comprehension even with the training data size reduced
 to around 4% of the factoid machine comprehension.  Thus, the how-to tip
 machine comprehension task requires much less training data compared
 with the factoid machine comprehension task.
