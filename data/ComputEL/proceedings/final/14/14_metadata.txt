Abstract#==#We present a case study of the methodology of using information extracted from
interlinear glossed text (IGT) to create of actual working HPSG grammar
fragments using the Grammar Matrix focusing on one language: Chintang.             
Though
the results are barely measurable in terms of coverage over running text, they
nonetheless provide a proof of concept.  Our experience report
reflects on the ways in which this task is non-trivial and on mismatches
between the assumptions of the methodology and the realities of IGT as produced
in a large-scale field project.
