Abstract#==#The vocabularies of endangered languages surrounded by more prestigious
languages are gradually shrinking in size due to the influx of borrowed items.
It is easy to observe that in such languages, starting from some frequency
rank, the lower the frequency of a vocabulary item, the higher the probability
of that item being a borrowed one. On the basis of the data from the Beserman
dialect of Udmurt, the article provides a model according to which the portion
of borrowed items among the items with frequency ranks less than r increases
logarithmically in r, starting from some rank r0, while for more frequent
items, it can behave differently. Apart from theoretical interest, the model
can be used to roughly predict the total number of native items in the
vocabulary based on a limited corpus of texts.
