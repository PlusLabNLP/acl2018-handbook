Abstract#==#LingSync and the Online Linguistic Database (OLD) are new models for the
collection and management of data in endangered language settings. The LingSync
and OLD projects seek to close a feedback loop between field linguists,
language communities, software developers, and computational linguists by
creating web services and user interfaces which facilitate collaborative and
inclusive language documentation. This paper presents the architectures of
these tools and the resources generated thus far. We also briefly discuss some
of the features of the systems which are particularly helpful to endangered
languages fieldwork and which should also be of interest to computational
linguists, these being a service that automates the identification of
utterances within audio/video, another that automates the alignment of audio
recordings and transcriptions, and a number of services that automate the
morphological parsing task. The paper discusses the requirements of software
used for endangered language documentation, and presents novel data which
demonstrates that users are actively seeking alternatives despite existing
software.
