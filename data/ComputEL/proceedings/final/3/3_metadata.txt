Abstract#==#The “D” in “DEL” stands for “documenting” – a code word for
linguists that means the collection of linguistic data in audio and written
form. The DEL (Documenting Endangered Languages) program run by the NSF and NEH
is thus centered around building and archiving data resources for endangered
languages. This paper is an argument for extending the ‘D’ to include
“describing” languages in terms of lexical, semantic, morphological and
grammatical knowledge. We present an overview of descriptive computational
tools aimed at endangered languages along with a longer summary of two
particular computer programs: Linguist’s Assistant and Boas. These two
programs, respectively, represent research in the areas of: A) computational
systems capable of representing lexical, morphological and grammatical
structures and using the resulting computational models for translation in a
minority language context, and B) tools for efficiently and accurately
acquiring linguistic knowledge. A hoped-for side effect of this paper is to
promote cooperation between these areas of research in order to provide a total
solution to describing endangered languages.
