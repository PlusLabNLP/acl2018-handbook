Abstract#==#The Kamusi Project, a multilingual online dictionary website, has as one of its
goals to document the lexicons of endangered and less-resourced languages
(LRLs). Kamusi.org provides a unified platform and repository for this kind of
data that is both simple to use and free to researchers and the public. Since
Kamusi has a separate entry for each homophone or polyseme, it can be used to
produce sophisticated multilingual dictionaries. We have recently been
confronting issues inherent in contact language-based lexicography, especially
the elicitation of culturally-specific semantic terms, which cannot be obtained
through fieldwork purely reliant on a contact language. To address this, we
have designed a system of “balloons.” Based on a variety of factors,
balloons raise the likelihood of revealing terms and fields that have
particular relevance within a culture, rather than perpetuating linguistic bias
toward the concerns and artifacts of more powerful groups. Kamusi has also
developed a smartphone application which can be used for crowdsourcing
contributions and validation.  It will also be invaluable in gathering oral
data from speakers of endangered languages for the production of monolingual
talking dictionaries. The first of these projects is planned for the Arrernte
language in central Australia.
