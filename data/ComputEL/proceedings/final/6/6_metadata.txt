Abstract#==#We are building an analytical data warehouse for linguistic data – primarily
lexicons and phonological data – for languages in the Asia-Pacific region. 
This paper briefly out-lines the project, making the point that the need for
improved technology for endangered and low-density language data extends well
beyond completion of fieldwork.  We suggest that shared task evaluation
challenges (STECs) are an appropriate model to follow for creating this
technology, and that stocking data warehouses with clean bronze-standard data
and baseline tools – no mean task – is an effective way to elicit the broad
collaboration from linguists and computer scientists needed to create the
gold-standard data that STECs require.
