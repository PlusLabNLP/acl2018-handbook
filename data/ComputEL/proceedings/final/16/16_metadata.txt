Abstract#==#Proliferating smartphones and mobile software provide linguists with a
scalable, networked recording device. This paper describes Aikuma, a mobile app
that is designed to put the key language documentation tasks of recording,
respeaking, and translating in the hands of a speech community. After
motivating the approach, we describe the system, and briefly report on its use
in field tests.
