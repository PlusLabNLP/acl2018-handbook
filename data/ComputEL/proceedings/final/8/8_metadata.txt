Abstract#==#This paper examines approaches to generate lexical resources for endangered
languages. Our algorithms construct bilingual dictionaries and multilingual
thesauruses using public Wordnets and a machine translator. Since our work
relies on only one bilingual dictionary between an endangered language and an 
"intermediate helper" language, it is applicable to languages that lack many
existing resources.
