Abstract#==#This paper describes a local effort to bridge the gap between computational and
documentary linguistics by teaching students and young researchers in
computational linguistics about doing research and developing systems for
low-resource languages. We describe four student software projects developed
within one semester. The projects range from a front-end for
building small-vocabulary speech recognition systems, to a broad-coverage (more
than 1000 languages) language identification system, to language-specific
systems: a lemmatizer for the Mayan language Uspanteko and named entity
recognition systems for both Slovak and Persian. Teaching efforts such as these
are an excellent way to develop not only tools for low-resource languages, but
also computational linguists well-equipped to work on endangered and
low-resource languages.
