Abstract#==#This cutting-edge tutorial proposal, targeting ACL/EMNLP 2020, recapitulates state-of-the-art Natural Language models and dives into modern general techniques for reducing model
size and latency without significant quality losses, which are essential for real-time inference under typical production serving constraints.

Recent advances in Natural Language Processing have substantially improved model capabilities and for many industry applications, production systems with learned models up to date with the state-of-the-art are meeting high quality bars for adoption across a wide variety of language tasks.

However, such cutting-edge models typically have hundreds of millions of parameters and therefore latency, cost and memory constraints remain a challenge. For diverse reasons, some applications require small models running cheaply on CPUs (on server or on device), while many need low latency models e.g. for a smooth user experience.

The first core session focuses on fast inference. We discuss cutting-edge small and shallow network alternatives and the resource vs model quality trade-off, showing case for their usage under budget-constrained environments.

The second core section dives into distillation techniques, covering the latest techniques to build accurate NLP models that fit memory and latency constraints.
