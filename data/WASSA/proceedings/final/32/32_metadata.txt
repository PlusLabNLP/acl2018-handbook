Abstract#==#This paper presents a pioneering research
on aspect-level sentiment analysis
in Czech. The main contribution of the
paper is the newly created Czech aspectlevel
sentiment corpus, based on data from
restaurant reviews. We annotated the corpus
with two variants of aspect-level sentiment
– aspect terms and aspect categories.
The corpus consists of 1,244 sentences and
1,824 annotated aspects and is freely available
to the research community. Furthermore,
we propose a baseline system based
on supervised machine learning. Our
system detects the aspect terms with Fmeasure
68.65% and their polarities with
accuracy 66.27%. The categories are recognized
with F-measure 74.02% and their
polarities with accuracy 66.61%.
