Abstract#==#Consumers increasingly inform their purchase decisions with opinions and other
information found on the Web. Unfortunately, the ease of posting content
online, potentially anonymously, combined with the public's trust and growing
reliance on this content, creates opportunities and incentives for abuse. This
is especially wor-risome in the case of online reviews of products and
services, where businesses may feel pres-sure to post deceptive opinion
spam---fictitious reviews disguised to look like authentic custom-er reviews.

In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to identify deceptive
opinion spam based on linguistic cues in a review's text. In this talk I will
summarize a few of these ap-proaches. I will additionally discuss some of the
challenges researchers face when studying this problem, including the
difficulty of obtaining labeled data, uncertainties surrounding the prev-alence
of deception, and how linguistic cues to deceptive opinion spam vary with the
text's sen-timent (e.g., 5-star vs 1- and 2-star reviews), domain (e.g., hotel
vs. restaurant reviews) and the domain expertise of the author (e.g.,
crowdsourced vs. employee-written deceptive opinion spam).
