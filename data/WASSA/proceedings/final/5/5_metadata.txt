Abstract#==#Irony is an important device in human communication, both in everyday spoken
conversations as well as in written texts including books, websites, chats,
reviews, and Twitter messages among others.
Specific cases of irony and sarcasm have been studied in different contexts but
to the best of our knowledge, only recently the first publicly available corpus
including annotations about whether a text
is ironic or not has been published by Filatova (2012). However, no baseline
for classification of
ironic or sarcastic reviews has been provided.
With this paper, we aim at closing this gap. We formulate the problem as a
supervised classification task and evaluate different classifiers, reaching an
F1-measure of up to 74% using logistic regression. We analyze the impact of a
number of features which have been proposed in previous research as well as
combinations of them.
