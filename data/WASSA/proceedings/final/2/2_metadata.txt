Abstract#==#We present a new feature type named rating-based feature and evaluate the
contribution of this feature to the task of document-level sentiment analysis.
We achieve state-of-the-art results on two publicly available standard polarity
movie datasets: on the dataset consisting of 2000 reviews produced by Pang and
Lee (2004) we obtain an accuracy of 91.6% while it is 89.87% evaluated on the
dataset of 50000 reviews created by Maas et al. (2011). We also get a
performance at 93.24% on our own dataset consisting of 233600 movie reviews,
and we aim to share this dataset for further research in sentiment polarity
analysis task.
