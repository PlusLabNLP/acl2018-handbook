Abstract#==#Beyond literal meaning, words have associations with sentiment, emotion,
colour, and even mu-sic. Identifying such associations is of substan-tial
benefit for information visualization, data sonification, and sentiment
analysis, which in turn have applications in commerce, education, art, and
health. I will present methods to gener-ate high-coverage resources that
capture such associations. I will show how these resources can be used for
analyzing emotions in text, de-tecting personality from essays, and generating
music from novels. Finally, I will show how word-sentiment association lexicons
have helped create the top-ranking systems in recent SemEval competitions on
the sentiment analysis of social media posts.
