Abstract#==#Online political discussions have received a lot of attention over the past
years. In this paper we compare two sentiment lexicon approaches to classify
the sentiment of sentences from political discussions. The first approach is
based on applying the number of words between the target and the sentiment
words to weight the sentence sentiment score. The second approach is based on
using the shortest paths between target and sentiment words in a dependency
graph and linguistically motivated syntactic patterns expressed as dependency
paths. The methods are tested on a corpus of sentences from online Norwegian
political discussions. The results show that the method based on dependency
graphs performs significantly better than the word-based approach.
