Abstract#==#Opinion inference arises when opinions are expressed toward states and events
which positive or negatively affect entities, i.e., benefactive and malefactive
events. This paper addresses creating a lexicon of such events, which would be
helpful to infer opinions. Verbs may be ambiguous, in that some meanings may be
benefactive and others may be malefactive or neither. Thus, we use WordNet to
create a sense-level lexicon. We begin with seed senses culled from FrameNet
and expand the lexicon using WordNet relationships. The evaluations show that
the accuracy of the approach is well above baseline accuracy.
