Abstract#==#To overcome the increasingly time con-suming and potentially challenging
identification of key points and the associated rationales in large-scale
online deliberations, we propose a computational linguistics method that has
the potential of facilitating this process of reading and evaluating the text.
Our approach is novel in how we determine the sentiment of a rationale at the
sentence level and in that it includes a text similarity measure and
sentence-level sentiment analysis to achieve this goal.
