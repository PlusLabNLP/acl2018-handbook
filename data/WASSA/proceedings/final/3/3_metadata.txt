Abstract#==#In this research we focus on discriminating between emotive (emotionally
loaded) and non-emotive sentences. We define the problem from a linguistic
point of view assuming that emotive sentences stand out both lexically and
grammatically. We verify this assumption experimentally by comparing two sets
of such sentences in Japanese. The comparison is based on words, longer n-grams
as well as more sophisticated patterns. In the classification we use a novel
unsupervised learning algorithm based on the idea of language combinatorics.
The method reached results comparable to the state of the art, while the fact
that it is fully automatic makes it more efficient and language independent.
