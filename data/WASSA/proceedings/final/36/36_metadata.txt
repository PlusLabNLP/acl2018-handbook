Abstract#==#Automatic detection of figurative language is a challenging task in
computational linguistics. Recognising both literal and figurative meaning is
not trivial for a machine and in some cases it is hard even for humans. For
this reason novel and accurate systems able to recognise figurative languages
are necessary. We present in this paper a novel computational model capable to
detect sarcasm in the social network Twitter (a popular microblogging service
which allows users to post short messages). Our model is easy to implement and,
unlike previous systems, it does not include patterns of words as features. Our
seven sets of lexical features aim to detect sarcasm by its inner structure
(for example unexpectedness, intensity of the terms or imbalance between
registers), abstracting from the use of specific terms.
