Abstract#==#In this study we explore a novel technique for creation of polarity lexicons
from the Twitter streams in Russian and English. With this aim we make
preliminary filtering of subjective tweets using general domain-independent
lexicons in each language. Then the subjective tweets are used for extraction
of domain-specific sentiment words. Relying on co-occurrence statistics of
extracted words in a large unlabeled Twitter collections we utilize the Markov
random field framework for the word polarity classification. To evaluate the
quality of the obtained sentiment lexicons they are used for tweet sentiment
classification and outperformed previous results.
