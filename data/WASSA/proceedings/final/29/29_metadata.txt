Abstract#==#In this paper, we show how domain-specific noun polarity lexicons can be
induced. We focus on the generation of good candidates and compare two machine
learning scenarios
in order to establish an approach that enables                                       
     

high
precision.
Candidates are
generated on the basis of polarity preferences of adjectives derived from a
large domain-independent corpus. 
The polarity preference of a word, here an adjective, reflects the distribution
of positive, negative and neutral arguments the word take  (here: its nominal
head).
Given a noun modified by some adjectives, a vote among the polarity preferences
of these adjectives establishes  a good indictor of the polarity of the noun.
In our experiments with five domains, we achieved f-measure of 59% up to 88% on
the basis of two machine learning approaches carried out top of the preference
votes.
