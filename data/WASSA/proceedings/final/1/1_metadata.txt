Abstract#==#Determining relevant content automatically is a challenging task for any
aggregation system. In the business intelligence domain, particularly in the
application area of Online Reputation Management, it is important to classify
tweets based on whether they are customer comments which deserve rapid
attention or tweets from industry experts or sources regarding the higher-level
operations of a particular company.
We present an approach using a combination of linguistic and Twitter-specific
features to represent the stylistic properties of a tweet and examine the
efficacy of these in distinguishing between classes of tweets which have been
labelled using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
