Abstract#==#In the past years, there has been an increasing amount of research done in the
field of Senti-ment Analysis. This was motivated by the growth in the volume of
user-generated online data, the information flood in Social Media and the
applications Sentiment Analysis has to dif-ferent fields – Marketing,
Business Intelligence, e-Law Making, Decision Support Systems, etc. Although
many methods have been proposed to deal with sentiment detection and
classification in diverse types of texts and languages, many challenges still
arise when passing these meth-ods from the research settings to real-life
appli-cations. 

In this talk, we will describe the manner in which we employed machine
translation together with human-annotated data to extend a sentiment analysis
system to various languages. Addition-ally, we will describe how a joint
multilingual model that detects and classifies sentiments ex-pressed in texts
from Social Media has been de-veloped (at this point for Twitter and Facebook)
and demo its use in a real-life application: a pro-ject aimed at detecting the
citizens’ attitude on Science and Technology.
