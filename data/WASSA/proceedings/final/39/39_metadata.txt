Abstract#==#While various approaches to domain adaptation exist, the majority of them
requires knowledge of the target domain, and additional data, preferably
labeled. For a language like English, it is often feasible to match most of
those conditions, but in low-resource languages, it presents a problem. We
explore the situation when neither data nor other information about the target
domain is available. We use two samples of Danish, a low-resource language,
from the consumer review domain (film vs. company reviews) in a sentiment
analysis task. We observe dramatic performance drops when moving from one
domain to the other. We then introduce a simple offline method that makes
models more robust towards unseen domains, and observe relative improvements of
more than 50%.
