Abstract#==#Existing sentiment analysers are weak AI systems: they try to capture the
functionality of human sentiment detection faculty, without worrying about how
such faculty is realized in the hardware of the human. These analysers are
agnostic of the actual cognitive processes involved. This, however, does not
deliver when applications demand order of magnitude facelift in accuracy, as
well as insight into characteristics of sentiment detection process. In this
paper, we present a cognitive study of sentiment detection from the perspective
of strong AI. We study the sentiment detection process of a set of human
”sentiment readers”. Using eye-tracking, we show that on the way to
sentiment detection, humans first extract subjectivity. They focus attention on
a subset of sentences before arriving at the overall sentiment. This they do
either through ”anticipation” where sentences are skipped during the first
pass of reading, or through ”homing” where a subset of the sentences are
read over multiple passes, or through both. ”Homing” behaviour is also
observed at the sub-sentence level in complex sentiment phenomena like sarcasm.
