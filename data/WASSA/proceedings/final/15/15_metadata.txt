Abstract#==#This paper illustrates the use of deep semantic processing for sentiment
analysis. Existing methods for sentiment analysis use supervised approaches
which take into account all the subjective words and or phrases. Due to this,
the fact that not all of these words and phrases actually contribute to the
overall sentiment of the text is ignored. We propose an unsupervised rule-based
approach using deep semantic processing to identify only relevant subjective
terms. We generate a UNL (Universal Networking Language) graph for the input
text. Rules are applied on the graph to extract relevant terms. The sentiment
expressed in these terms is used to figure out the overall sentiment of the
text. Results on binary sentiment classification have shown promising results.
