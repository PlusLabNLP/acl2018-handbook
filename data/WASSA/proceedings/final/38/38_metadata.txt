Abstract#==#There are numerous studies suggesting that published news stories have
an important effect on the direction of the stock market, its
volatility, the volume of trades, and the value of individual stocks
mentioned in the news. There is even some published research
suggesting that automated sentiment analysis of news documents,
quarterly reports, blogs and/or Twitter data can be productively used
as part of a trading strategy. This paper presents just such a family
of trading strategies, and then uses this application to re-examine
some of the tacit assumptions behind how sentiment analyzers are 
generally evaluated, in spite of the contexts of their application.
This discrepancy comes at a cost.
