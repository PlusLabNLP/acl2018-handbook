Abstract#==#In this study, we aim to test our hypothesis that confidence scores of
sentiment values of tweets aid in classification of sentiment. We used several
feature sets consisting of lexical features, emoticons, features based on
sentiment scores and combination of lexical and sentiment features. Since our
dataset includes confidence scores of real numbers in [0-1] range, we employ
regression analysis on each class of sentiments. We determine the class label
of a tweet by
looking at the maximum of the confidence scores assigned to it by these
regressors. We test the results against classification results obtained by
converting the confidence scores into discrete labels. Thus, the strength of
sentiment is ignored. Our expectation was that taking the strength of sentiment
into consideration would improve the classification results. Contrary
to our expectations, our results indicate that using classification on discrete
class labels and ignoring sentiment strength perform similar to using
regression on continuous confidence scores.
