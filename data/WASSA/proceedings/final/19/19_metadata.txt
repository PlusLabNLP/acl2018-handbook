Abstract#==#Implicit opinions are commonly seen in opinion-oriented documents, such as
political editorials. Previous work have utilized opinion inference rules to
detect implicit opinions evoked by events that positively/negatively affect
entities (goodFor/badFor) to improve sentiment analysis for English text. Since
people in different languages may express implicit opinions in different ways,
in this work we investigate implicit opinions expressed via goodFor/badFor
events in Chinese. The positive results have provided evidences that such
implicit opinions and inference rules are similar in Chinese and in English.
Moreover, we have observed cases where the inferences are blocked.
