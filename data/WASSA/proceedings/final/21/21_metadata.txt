Abstract#==#In this paper we investigate the efficiency of the novel term weighting
algorithm for opin-ion mining and topic categorization of arti-cles from
newspapers and Internet. We com-pare the novel term weighting technique with
existing approaches such as TF-IDF and ConfWeight. The performance on the data
from the text-mining campaigns DEFT’07 and DEFT’08 shows that the proposed
meth-od can compete with existing information re-trieval models in
classification quality and that it is computationally faster. The pro-posed
text preprocessing method can be ap-plied in large-scale information retrieval
and data mining problems and it can be easily transported to different domains
and different languages since it does not require any domain-related or
linguistic information.
