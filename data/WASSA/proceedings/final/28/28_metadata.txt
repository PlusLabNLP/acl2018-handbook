Abstract#==#Past work on emotion processing has focused solely on detecting emotions, and
ignored questions such as `who is feeling the emotion (the experiencer)?'
and`towards whom is the emotion directed (the stimulus)?'.  We automatically
compile a large dataset of tweets pertaining to the 2012 US presidential
elections, and annotate it not only for emotion but also for the experiencer
and the stimulus. We then develop a classifier for detecting emotion that
obtains an F-score of 55.86 on a 7-way classification task. Finally, we show
how the stimulus identification task can also be framed as a classification
task, obtaining an F-score of 58.30.ompetitive baselines and obtains an F-score
of 58.30.
