Abstract#==#Metaphor is much more than a pyrotechnical flourish of language or a
fascinating conceptual puzzle: it is a cognitive lever that allows speakers to
leverage their knowledge of one domain to describe, re-frame and understand
another. Though NLP researchers tend to view metaphor as a problem to be
solved, metaphor is perhaps more fittingly seen as a solution to be used, that
is, as an important tool in the support of creative thinking and the generation
of diverse linguistic outputs. Since it pays to think of metaphor as a
foundational cognitive service, one that can be exploited in a wide array of
creative computational tasks, we present here a view of metaphor as a public
Web service that can be freely called on demand.
