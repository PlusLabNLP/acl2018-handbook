Abstract#==#Metaphor is a cognitive process that shapes abstract target concepts by mapping
them to concrete source concepts. Thus, many computational approaches to
metaphor make reference, directly or indirectly, to the abstractness of words
and concepts. The property of abstractness, however, remains theoretically and
empirically unexplored. This paper implements a multi-dimensional definition of
abstractness and tests the usefulness of each dimension for detecting
cross-domain mappings.
