Abstract#==#This article describes a novel approach to automated determination of affect
associated with metaphorical language. Affect in language is understood to mean
the attitude toward a topic that a writer attempts to convey to the reader by
using a particular metaphor. This affect, which we will classify as positive,
negative or neutral with various degrees of intensity, may arise from the
target of the metaphor, from the choice of words used to describe it, or from
other elements in its immediate linguistic context. We attempt to capture all
these contributing elements in an Affect Calculus and demonstrate
experimentally that the resulting method can accurately approximate human
judgment. The work reported here is part of a larger effort to develop a highly
accurate system for identifying, classifying, and comparing metaphors occurring
in large volumes of text across four different languages: English, Spanish,
Russian, and Farsi.
