Abstract#==#Much computational work has been done on identifying and interpreting the
meaning of metaphors, but little work has been done on understanding the
motivation behind the use of metaphor. To computationally model discourse and
social positioning in metaphor, we need a corpus annotated with metaphors
relevant to speaker intentions. This paper reports a corpus study as a first
step towards computational work on social and discourse functions of metaphor.
We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate data from three web
discussion forums covering distinct domains. We then compare these to
annotations from our own annotation scheme which distinguish levels of metaphor
with the labels: nonliteral, conventionalized, and literal. Our hope is that
this work raises questions about what new work needs to be done in order to
address the question of how metaphors are used to achieve social goals in
interaction.
