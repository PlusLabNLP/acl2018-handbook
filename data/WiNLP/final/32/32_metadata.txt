Abstract#==#As language and speech technologies become more advanced, the lack of fundamental digital
resources for African languages, such as data, spell checkers and PoS taggers, means that the
digital divide between these languages and others keeps growing. This work details the organisation of the AI4D - African Language Dataset Challenge, an effort to incentivize the creation,
curation and uncovering to African language datasets through a competitive challenge, particularly datasets that are annotated or prepared for use in a downstream NLP task.
