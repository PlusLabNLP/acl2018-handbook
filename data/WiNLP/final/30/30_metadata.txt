Abstract#==#Simplified languages are instruments for inclusion aiming to overcome language barriers. 
'Leichte Sprache' (LS), for instance, is a variation of German with reduced complexity (cf. Basic English).
So far LS is mainly provided FOR but rarely written BY its target groups, e.g. people with cognitive impairments. 
One reason might be the lack of technical support during the process from the message conceptualization to its realization. 
In the following, we present a system for assisted typing in LS that gains accuracy and speed by deploying real time natural-language processing to a large extend for efficient prediction and context-sensitive grammar support.
