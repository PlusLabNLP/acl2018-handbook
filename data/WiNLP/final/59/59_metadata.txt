Abstract#==#This abstract presents preliminary work in the application of natural language processing techniques and social network modeling for the prediction of cryptocurrency trading and investment
behavior. Specifically, we are building models to use language and social network behaviors to
predict if the tweets of a 24-hour period can be used to buy or sell cryptocurrency to make a
profit. In this paper we present our novel task and initial language modeling studies.
