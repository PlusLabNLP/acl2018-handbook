Abstract#==#Recently, the automatic prediction of personality traits has received increasing attention and has emerged as a hot topic within the field of affective computing.  A drawback of state-of-the-art automatic personality detection systems is their accuracy and computational performance. In this work, we focus on improving accuracy and speed at the same time using a novel deep-learning-based method for automated personality detection from text. We extract context-dependent word embeddings at a low computation cost by leveraging transfer learning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 1.04% and, at the same time, is significantly more computationally efficient to train.
