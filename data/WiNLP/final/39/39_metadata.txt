Abstract#==#Complex sentences are a hurdle in the learning process of language learners. Sentence simplification
aims to convert a complex sentence into its simpler form such that it is easily comprehensible. To
build such automated simplification systems, corpora of complex sentences and their simplified
versions is the first step to understand sentence complexity and enable the development of
automatic text simplification systems. No such corpus has yet been developed for Urdu and we fill
this gap by developing one such corpus to help start readability and automatic sentence
simplification research. We present a lexical and syntactically simplified Urdu simplification corpus
and a detailed analysis of the various simplification operations. We further analyze our corpora using
text readability measures and present a comparison of the original, lexical simplified, and
syntactically simplified corpora.
