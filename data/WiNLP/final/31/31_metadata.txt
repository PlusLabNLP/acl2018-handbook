Abstract#==#In the age of digital recruitment, candidates can apply for a job with a single click. Hence a job post can attract hundreds of applicants and screening them manually can become a very tedious task. Through this paper, we are proposing a multi-label "competency group" classifier, where a competency group can be thought of as a group of similar skills. Once a competency group is identified, it can be used as a filtering criterion to find relevant candidates for a job. For classifying a skill into competency groups, we have leveraged contextual language embedding models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). However, as BERT has not been explored on corpus specific to job domain, such as skill text, we propose SkillBERT, which uses BERT architecture but is trained from scratch on skills present in job requisitions and show a comparison of it with models like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and pre-trained BERT. Along with it, we also explored spectral clustering (Chung, 1997) on SkillBERT embeddings to generate cluster-based features. Best results were obtained by using a combination of SkillBERT and spectral clustering-based features and, applying Bi-LSTM (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) as a classifier.
