Abstract#==#Identifying the reasons for antibiotic administration in veterinary records is a critical component of understanding antimicrobial usage patterns.  This informs antimicrobial stewardship programs designed to fight antimicrobial resistance, a major health crisis affecting both humans and animals in which veterinarians have an important role to play.  We propose a document classification approach to determine the reason for administration of a given drug, with particular focus on domain adaptation from one drug to another, and instance selection to minimize annotation effort.
