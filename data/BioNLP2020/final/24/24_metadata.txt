Abstract#==#Research on analyzing reading patterns of dyslectic children
has mainly been driven by classifying dyslexia types offline.
We contend that a framework to remedy reading errors inline
is more far-reaching and will help to further advance our
understanding of this impairment. In this paper, we propose
a simple and intuitive neural model to reinstate migrating
words that transpire in letter position dyslexia, a visual
analysis deficit to the encoding of character order within
a word. Introduced by the anagram matrix representation of an
input verse, the novelty of our work lies in the expansion
from one to a two dimensional context window for training.
This warrants words that only differ in the disposition of
letters to remain interpreted semantically similar in the
embedding space. Subject to the apparent constraints of the
self-attention transformer architecture, our model achieved
a unigram BLEU score of 40.6 on our reconstructed dataset
of the Shakespeare sonnets.
