Abstract#==#How do we most effectively treat a disease or condition?
Ideally, we could consult a database of evidence gleaned from clinical trials to answer such questions. Unfortunately, no such database exists; clinical trial results are instead disseminated primarily via lengthy natural language articles. Perusing all such articles would be prohibitively time-consuming for healthcare practitioners; they instead tend to depend on manually compiled \emph{systematic reviews} of medical literature to inform care.

NLP may speed this process up, and eventually facilitate immediate consult of published evidence. The \emph{Evidence Inference} dataset was recently released to facilitate research toward this end. This task entails inferring the comparative performance of two treatments, with respect to a given outcome, from a particular article (describing a clinical trial) and identifying supporting evidence. For instance: Does this article report that \textit{chemotherapy} performed better than \textit{surgery} for \textit{five-year survival rates} of operable cancers? In this paper, we collect additional annotations to expand the Evidence Inference dataset by 25\%, provide stronger baseline models, systematically inspect the errors that these make, and probe dataset quality. We also release an \emph{abstract only} (as opposed to full-texts) version of the task for rapid model prototyping. The updated corpus, documentation, and code for new baselines and evaluations are available at \url{http://evidence-inference.ebm-nlp.com/}.
