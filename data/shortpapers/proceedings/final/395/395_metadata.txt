Abstract#==#BLANC is a link-based coreference evaluation
metric for measuring the quality
of coreference systems on gold mentions.
This paper extends the original
BLANC (“BLANC-gold” henceforth) to
system mentions, removing the gold mention
assumption. The proposed BLANC
falls back seamlessly to the original one if
system mentions are identical to gold mentions,
and it is shown to strongly correlate
with existing metrics on the 2011 and 2012
CoNLL data.
