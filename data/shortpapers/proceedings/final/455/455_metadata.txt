Abstract#==#Relation extraction suffers from a performance loss when a model is applied to
out-of-domain data. This has fostered the development of domain adaptation
techniques for relation extraction. This paper evaluates word embeddings and
clustering on adapting feature-based relation extraction systems. We
systematically explore various ways to apply word embeddings and show the best
adaptation improvement by combining word cluster and word embedding
information. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of regularization for
the adaptability of relation extractors.
