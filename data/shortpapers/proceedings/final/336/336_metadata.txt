Abstract#==#The primary way of providing real-time speech to text captioning for hard of
hearing people is to employ expensive professional stenographers who can type
as fast as natural speaking rates. Recent work has shown that a feasible
alternative is to combine the partial captions of ordinary typists, each of
whom is able to type only part of what they hear. In this paper, we extend the
state of the art fixed-window alignment algorithm (Naim et al., 2013) for
combining the individual captions into a final output sequence. Our method
performs alignment on a sliding window of the input sequences, drastically
reducing both the number of errors and the latency of the system to the end
user over the previously published approaches.
