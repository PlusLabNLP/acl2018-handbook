Abstract#==#We consider the prediction of three human behavioral measures – lexical
decision, word naming, and picture naming – through the lens of domain bias
in language modeling. Contrasting the predictive ability of statistics derived
from 6 different corpora, we find intuitive results showing that, e.g., a
British corpus over-predicts the speed with which an American will react to the
words ward and duke, and that the Google n-grams over-predicts familiarity with
technology terms. This study aims to provoke increased consideration of the
human language model by NLP practitioners: biases are not limited to
differences between corpora (i.e. “train” vs. “test”); they can exist
as well between corpora and the intended user of the resultant technology.
