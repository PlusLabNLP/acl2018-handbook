Abstract#==#Automatically detecting verbal irony (roughly, sarcasm) is a challenging task
because ironists say something other than – and often opposite to – what
they actually mean. Discerning ironic intent exclusively from the words and
syntax comprising texts (e.g., tweets, forum posts) is therefore not always
possible: additional contextual information about the speaker and/or the topic
at hand is often necessary. We introduce a new corpus that provides empirical
evidence for this claim. We show that annotators frequently require context to
make judgements concerning ironic intent, and that machine learning approaches
tend to misclassify those same comments for which annotators required
additional context.
