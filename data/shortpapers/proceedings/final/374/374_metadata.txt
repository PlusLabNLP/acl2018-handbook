Abstract#==#We quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives using a corpus-based method,
and show for the first time that it correlates with noun concreteness in large
corpora. These cognitive dimensions together influence how word meanings
combine, and we exploit this fact to achieve performance improvements on the
semantic classification of adjective-noun pairs.
