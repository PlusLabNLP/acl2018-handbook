Abstract#==#In this paper we introduce a semantic role labeler for Korean, an agglutinative
language with rich morphology. First, we create a novel training source by
semantically annotating a Korean corpus containing fine-grained morphological
and syntactic information. We then develop a supervised SRL model by leveraging
morphological features of Korean that tend to correspond with semantic roles.
Our model also employs a variety of latent morpheme representations induced
from a larger body of unannotated Korean text. These elements lead to
state-of-the-art performance of 81.07% labeled F1, representing the best SRL
performance reported to date for an agglutinative language.
