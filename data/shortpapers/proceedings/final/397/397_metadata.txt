Abstract#==#Wouldn't it be helpful if your text editor automatically suggested papers
that are relevant to your research? Wouldn't it be even better if those
suggestions were contextually relevant? In this paper we name a system that
would accomplish this a context-based citation recommendation (CBCR) system. We
specifically present Citation Resolution, a method for the evaluation of CBCR
systems which exclusively uses readily-available scientific articles.
Exploiting the human judgements that are already implicit in available
resources, we avoid purpose-specific annotation. We apply this evaluation to
three sets of methods for representing a document, based on a) the contents of
the document, b) the surrounding contexts of citations to the document found in
other documents, and c) a mixture of the two.
