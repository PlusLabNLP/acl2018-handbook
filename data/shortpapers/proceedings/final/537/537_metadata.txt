Abstract#==#Previous research has established several methods of online learning for latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  However, streaming learning for LDA---allowing
only one pass over the data and constant storage complexity---is not as well
explored.  We use reservoir sampling to reduce the storage complexity of a
previously-studied online algorithm, namely the particle filter, to constant. 
We then show that a simpler particle filter implementation performs just as
well, and that the quality of the initialization dominates other factors of
performance.
