Abstract#==#As students read expository text, comprehension is improved by pausing to
answer questions that reinforce the material. We describe an automatic question
generator that uses semantic pattern recognition to create questions of varying
depth and type for self-study or tutoring. Throughout, we explore how
linguistic considerations inform system design. In the described system,
semantic role labels of source sentences are used in a domain-independent
manner to generate both questions and answers related to the source sentence.
Evaluation results show a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to the best
prior systems, averaging over all metrics, and up to 61% reduction in the error
rate on grammaticality judgments.
