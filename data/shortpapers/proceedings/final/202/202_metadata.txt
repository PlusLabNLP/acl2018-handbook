Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel derivation structure prediction (DSP) model
for SMT using recursive  neural network (RNN). Within the model, two steps are
involved: (1) phrase-pair vector representation, to learn vector
representations for phrase pairs; (2) derivation structure prediction, to
generate a bilingual RNN that aims to distinguish good derivation structures
from bad ones. Final experimental results show that our DSP model can
significantly improve the translation quality.
