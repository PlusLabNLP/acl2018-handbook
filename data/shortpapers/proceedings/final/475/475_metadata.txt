Abstract#==#Recent work has sparked new interest in type-supervised part-of-speech tagging,
a data setting in which no labeled sentences are available, but the set of
allowed tags is known for each word type. This paper describes observational
initialization, a novel technique for initializing EM when training a
type-supervised HMM tagger. Our initializer allocates probability mass to
unambiguous transitions in an unlabeled corpus, generating token-level
observations from type-level supervision.  Experimentally, observational
initialization gives state-of-the-art type-supervised tagging accuracy,
providing an error reduction of 56% over uniform initialization on the Penn
English Treebank.
