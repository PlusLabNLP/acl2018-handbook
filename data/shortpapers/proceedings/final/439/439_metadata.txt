Abstract#==#How do journalists mark quoted content as certain or uncertain, and how do
readers interpret these signals? Predicates such as "thinks", "claims", and
"admits" offer a range of options for framing quoted content according to the
author's own perceptions of its credibility. We gather a new dataset of direct
and indirect quotes from Twitter, and obtain annotations of the perceived
certainty of the quoted statements. We then compare the ability of linguistic
and extra-linguistic features to predict readers' assessment of the certainty
of quoted content. We see that readers are indeed influenced by such framing
devices --- and we find no evidence that they consider other factors, such as
the source, journalist, or the content itself. In addition, we examine the
impact of specific framing devices on perceptions of credibility.
