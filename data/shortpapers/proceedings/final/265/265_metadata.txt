Abstract#==#Supervised text classification algorithms require a large number of documents
labeled by humans, that involve a labor-intensive and time consuming process.
In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised algorithm in which supervision
comes in the form of labeling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics. We
then use this weak supervision to ``sprinkle'' artificial words to the training
documents to identify topics in accordance with the underlying class structure
of the corpus based on the higher order word associations. We evaluate this
approach to improve performance of text classification on three real world
datasets.
