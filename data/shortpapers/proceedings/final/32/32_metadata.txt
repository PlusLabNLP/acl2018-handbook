Abstract#==#While many lexica annotated with words polarity are available for sentiment
analysis, very few tackle the harder task of emotion analysis and are
usually quite limited in coverage. In this paper, we present a novel approach
for extracting - in a totally automated way - a high-coverage and
high-precision lexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated  
with emotion scores, called DepecheMood. 
Our approach exploits in an original way `crowd-sourced' affective annotation
implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com. 
By providing new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for
regression and classification tasks, even using a naive approach, our
experiments show the 
beneficial impact of harvesting
social media data for affective lexicon building
