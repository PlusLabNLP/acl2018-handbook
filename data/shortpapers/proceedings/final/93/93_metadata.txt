Abstract#==#Sentiment relevance detection problems occur when there is a sentiment
expression in a text, and there is the question of whether or not the
expression is related to a given entity or, more generally, to a given
situation. The paper discusses variants of the problem, and shows that it is
distinct from other somewhat similar problems occurring in the field of
sentiment analysis and opinion mining. We experimentally demonstrate that using
the in-formation about relevancy significantly affects the final sentiment
evaluation of the entities. We then compare a set of different algorithms for
solving the relevance detection problem. The most accurate results are achieved
by algorithms that use certain document-level information about the target
entities. We show that this information can be accurately extracted using
supervised classification methods.
