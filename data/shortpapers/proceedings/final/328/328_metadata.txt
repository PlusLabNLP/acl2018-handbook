Abstract#==#We propose a novel approach to cross-lingual model transfer based on feature
representation projection.
First, a compact feature representation relevant for the task in question is
constructed for either language independently and then the mapping between the
two representations is determined using parallel data.
The target instance can then be mapped into the source-side feature
representation using the derived mapping and handled directly by the
source-side model.
This approach displays competitive performance on model transfer for semantic
role labeling when compared to direct model transfer and annotation projection
and suggests interesting directions for further research.
