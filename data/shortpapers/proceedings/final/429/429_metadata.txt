Abstract#==#Modern statistical dependency parsers assign lexical heads to punctuations as
well as words. Punctuation parsing errors lead to low parsing accuracy on
words.
  In this work, we propose an alternative approach to addressing punctuation in
dependency parsing. Rather than assigning lexical heads to punctuations, we
treat punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words, used as features
to guide the parser to build the dependency graph.
  Integrating our method with a arc-standard parser yields a 93.06% unlabelled
attachment score, which is the best accuracy by a single-model transition-based
parser reported so far.
