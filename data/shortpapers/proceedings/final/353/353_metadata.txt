Abstract#==#The relative frequencies of character bigrams appear to contain much
information for predicting the first language (L1) of the writer of a text in
another language (L2). Tsur and Rappoport (2007) interpret this fact as
evidence that word choice is dictated by the phonology of L1. In order to test
their hypothesis, we design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative
words
and the corresponding character bigrams,and perform two experiments to quantify
their impact on the L1 identification task. The results strongly suggest an
alternative explanation of the effectiveness of character bigrams in
identifying the native language of a writer.
