Abstract#==#In this paper we extend the cube-pruned dependency parsing framework of Zhang
et al. (2012; 2013) by forcing inference to maintain both label and structural
ambiguity. The resulting parser achieves state-of-the-art accuracies, in
particular on datasets with a large set of dependency labels.
