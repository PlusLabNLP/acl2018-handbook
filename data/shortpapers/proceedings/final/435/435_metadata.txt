Abstract#==#Emotion lexicons play a crucial role in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.
In this paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware LDA (EaLDA) model to build a
domain-specific lexicon for predefined emotions that include anger, disgust,
fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The model uses a minimal set of
domain-independent seed words as prior knowledge to discover a domain-specific
lexicon, learning a fine-grained emotion lexicon much richer and adaptive to a
specific domain. By comprehensive experiments, we show that our model can
generate a high-quality fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon.
