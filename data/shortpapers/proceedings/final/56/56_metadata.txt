Abstract#==#Tree kernel is an effective technique for relation extraction. However, the
traditional syntactic tree representation is often too coarse or ambiguous to
accurately capture the semantic relation information between two entities. In
this paper, we propose a new tree kernel, called feature-enriched tree kernel
(FTK), which can enhance the traditional tree kernel by: 1) refining the
syntactic tree representation by an-notating each tree node with a set of
discriminant features; and 2) proposing a new tree kernel which can better
measure the syntactic tree similarity by taking all features into
consideration. Experimental results show that our method can achieve a 5.4%
F-measure improvement over the traditional convolution tree kernel.
