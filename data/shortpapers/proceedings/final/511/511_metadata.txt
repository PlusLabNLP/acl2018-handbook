Abstract#==#We present richer typesetting models that extend the unsupervised historical
document recognition system of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2013). The first model
breaks the independence assumption between vertical offsets of neighboring
glyphs and, in experiments, substantially decreases transcription error rates.
The second model simultaneously learns multiple font styles and, as a result,
is able to accurately track italic and non-italic portions of documents. Richer
models complicate inference so we present a new, streamlined procedure that is
over 25x faster than the method used by Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2013). Our
final system achieves a relative word error reduction of 22% compared to
state-of-the-art results on a dataset of historical newspapers.
