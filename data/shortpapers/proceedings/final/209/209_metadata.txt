Abstract#==#This work explores methods of automatically detecting corrections of individual
mistakes in sentence revisions for ESL students. We have trained a classifier
that specializes in determining whether consecutive basic-edits (word
insertions, deletions, substitutions) address the same mistake. Experimental
result shows that the proposed system achieves an F1 -score of 81% on
correction detection and 66% for the overall system, out-performing the
baseline by a large margin.
