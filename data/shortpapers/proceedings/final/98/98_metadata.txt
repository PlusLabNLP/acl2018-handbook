Abstract#==#We propose Adaptive Recursive Neural Network (AdaRNN) for target-dependent
Twitter sentiment classification. AdaRNN adaptively propagates the sentiments
of words to target depending on the context and syntactic relationships between
them. It consists of more than one composition functions, and we model the
adaptive sentiment propagations as distributions over these composition
functions. The experimental studies illustrate that AdaRNN improves the
baseline methods. Furthermore, we introduce a manually annotated dataset for
target-dependent Twitter sentiment analysis.
