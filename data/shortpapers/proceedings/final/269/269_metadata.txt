Abstract#==#We present a new approach to inducing the syntactic categories of words,
combining their distributional and morphological properties in a joint
nonparametric Bayesian model based on the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant
Process. In this framework, a log-linear model of morphological similarity acts
as a prior distribution over word clusterings; the likelihood function is the
probability of generating vector word embeddings. The weights of the morphology
model are learned jointly while inducing part-of-speech clusters, and are
therefore driven to cohere with the distributional features. The resulting
algorithm outperforms competitive alternatives on English POS induction.
