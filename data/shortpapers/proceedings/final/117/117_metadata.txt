Abstract#==#We test both bottom-up and top-down approaches in learning the phonemic status
of the sounds of English and Japanese. We used large corpora of spontaneous
speech to provide the learner with an input that models both the linguistic
properties and statistical regularities of each language. We found both
approaches to help discriminate between allophonic and phonemic contrasts with
a high degree of accuracy, although top-down cues proved to be effective only
on an interesting subset of the data.
