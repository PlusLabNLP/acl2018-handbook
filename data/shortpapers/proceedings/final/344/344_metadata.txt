Abstract#==#Latent topics derived by topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
are the result of hidden thematic structures which provide further insights
into the data. The automatic labelling of such topics derived from social media
poses however new challenges since topics may characterise novel events
happening in the real world. 
Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which depend on external
knowledge sources become less applicable here since relevant articles/concepts
of the extracted topics may not exist in external sources. In this paper we
propose to address the problem of automatic labelling of latent topics learned
from Twitter as a summarisation problem. We introduce a framework which apply
summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels. These algorithms are
independent of external sources and only rely on the identification of dominant
terms in documents reletated to the latent topic.
We compare the efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation
algorithms. Our results suggest that summarisation algorithms generate better
topic labels which capture event-related context compared to the top-n terms
returned by LDA.
