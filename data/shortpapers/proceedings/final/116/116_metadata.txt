Abstract#==#Convolution tree kernels are an efficient and effective method for comparing
syntactic structures in NLP methods. However, current kernel methods such as
subset tree kernel and partial tree kernel understate the similarity of very
similar tree structures. Although soft-matching approaches can improve the
similarity scores, they are corpus-dependent and match relaxations may be
task-specific. We propose an alternative approach called descending path kernel
which gives intuitive similarity scores on comparable structures. This method
is evaluated on two temporal relation extraction tasks and demonstrates its
advantage over rich syntactic representations.
