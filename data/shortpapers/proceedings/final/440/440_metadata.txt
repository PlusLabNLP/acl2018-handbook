Abstract#==#The disambiguation algorithm presented in this paper is implemented in
SemLinker, an entity linking system. First, named entities are linked to
candidate Wikipedia pages by a generic annotation engine. Then, the algorithm
re-ranks candidate links according to mutual relations between all the named
entities found in the document. The evaluation is based on experiments
conducted on the test corpus of the TAC-KBP 2012 entity linking task.
