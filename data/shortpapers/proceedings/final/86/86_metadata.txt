Abstract#==#Unsupervised word segmentation (UWS) can provide domain-adaptive segmentation
for statistical machine translation (SMT) without annotated data, and bilingual
UWS can even optimize segmentation for alignment. Monolingual UWS approaches of
explicitly modeling the probabilities of words through Dirichlet process (DP)
models or Pitman-Yor process (PYP) models have achieved high accuracy, but
their bilingual counterparts have only been carried out on small corpora such
as basic travel expression corpus (BTEC) due to the computational complexity. 
This paper proposes an efficient unified PYP-based monolingual and bilingual
UWS method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to
supervised segmenters on the in-domain NIST OpenMT corpus, and yields a 0.96
BLEU relative increase on NTCIR PatentMT corpus which is out-of-domain.
