Abstract#==#The definitions of two coreference scoring metrics---B3 and CEAF---are
underspecified with respect to predicted, as opposed to key (or gold) mentions.
Several variations have been proposed that manipulate either, or both, the key
and predicted mentions in order to get a one-to-one mapping. On the other hand,
the metric BLANC was, until recently, limited to scoring partitions of key
mentions. In this paper, we (i) argue that mention manipulation for scoring
predicted mentions is unnecessary, and potentially harmful as it could produce
unintuitive results; (ii) illustrate the application of all these measures to
scoring predicted mentions; (iii) make available an open-source,
thoroughly-tested reference implementation of the main coreference evaluation
measures; and (iv) rescore the results of the CoNLL-2011/2012 shared task
systems with this implementation. This will help the community accurately
measure and compare new end-to-end coreference resolution algorithms.
