Abstract#==#We develop a semantic parsing framework based on semantic similarity for open
domain question answering (QA). We focus on single-relation questions and
decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern. Using
convolutional neural network models, we measure the similarity of entity
mentions with entities in the knowledge base (KB) and the similarity of
relation patterns and relations in the KB. We score relational triples in the
KB using these measures and select the top scoring relational triple to answer
the question. When evaluated on an open-domain QA task, our method achieves
higher precision across different recall points compared to the previous
approach, and can improve F1 by 7 points.
