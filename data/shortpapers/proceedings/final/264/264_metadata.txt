Abstract#==#Noisy channel models, widely used in modern spellers, cope with typical
misspellings,but do not work well with infrequent and difficult spelling
errors. In this paper, we have improved the noisy channel approach by iterative
stochastic search for the best correction. The proposed algorithm allowed us to
avoid local minima problem and improve the F1 measure by 6.6% on distant
spelling errors.
