Abstract#==#This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar measurement of
metaphoricity. Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which
represents how metaphoric that sentence is. This measure achieves a correlation
of 0.450 (Pearson's R, p < 0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity
involving human participants. While far from perfect, this scalar measure of
metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor
identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets. When reduced to a
binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the
system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable
binary classification system's 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches.
