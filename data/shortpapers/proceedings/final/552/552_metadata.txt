Abstract#==#Many methods of text summarization combining sentence selection and sentence
compression have recently been proposed. Although the dependency between words
has been used in most of these methods, the dependency between sentences, 
i.e., rhetorical structures, has not been exploited in such joint methods. We
used both dependency between words and dependency between sentences by
constructing a nested tree, in which nodes in the document tree representing
dependency between sentences were replaced by a sentence tree representing
dependency between words. We formulated a summarization task as a combinatorial
optimization problem, in which the nested tree was trimmed without losing
important content in the source document. The results from an empirical
evaluation revealed that our method based on the trimming of the nested tree
significantly improved the summarization of texts.
