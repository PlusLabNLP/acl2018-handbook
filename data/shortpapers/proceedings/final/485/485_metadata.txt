Abstract#==#We introduce XMEANT---a new cross-lingual version of the semantic frame based
MT evaluation metric MEANT---which can correlate even more closely with human
adequacy judgments than monolingual MEANT and eliminates the need for expensive
human references. Previous work established that MEANT reflects translation
adequacy with state-of-the-art accuracy, and optimizing MT systems against
MEANT robustly improves translation quality. However, to go beyond tuning
weights in the loglinear SMT model, a cross-lingual objective function that can
deeply integrate semantic frame criteria into the MT training pipeline is
needed. We show that cross-lingual XMEANT outperforms monolingual MEANT by (1)
replacing the monolingual context vector model in MEANT with simple translation
probabilities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG constraints.
