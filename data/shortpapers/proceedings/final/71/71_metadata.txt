Abstract#==#In this paper, we present multiple approaches to improve sentiment analysis on
Twitter data. We first establish a state-of-the-art baseline with a rich
feature set. Then we build a topic-based sentiment mixture model with
topic-specific data in a semi-supervised training framework. The topic
information is generated through topic modeling based on an efficient
implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The proposed sentiment
model outperforms the top system in the task of Sentiment Analysis in Twitter
in SemEval-2013 in terms of averaged F scores.
