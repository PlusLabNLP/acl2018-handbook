Abstract#==#Transfer learning method has been used in opinion analysis to make use of
available language resources for other resource-poor languages. However, the
cumulative class noise in transfer learning can adversely affect performance
when more training data is used. In this paper, we propose a novel method in
transductive transfer learning to identify noises through the detection of
negative transfers. Evaluation on NLP&CC 2013 cross-lingual opinion analysis
dataset shows that our approach outperformed the state-of-the-art systems. More
signifi-cantly, our system shows a monotonic increase trend in performance
improvement when more training data are used.
