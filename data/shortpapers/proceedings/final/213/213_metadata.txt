Abstract#==#Event extraction generally suffers from the data sparseness problem. In this
paper, we address this problem by utilizing the labeled data from two different
languages. As a preliminary study, we mainly focus on the subtask of trigger
type determination in event extraction. To make the training data in different
languages help each other, we propose a uniform text representation with
bilingual features to represent the samples and handle the difficulty of
locating the triggers in the translated text from both monolingual and
bilingual perspectives. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach to bilingual classification on trigger type determination.
