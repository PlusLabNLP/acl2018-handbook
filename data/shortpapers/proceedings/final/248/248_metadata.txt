Abstract#==#Recently, users who search on the web are targeting to more complex tasks due
to the explosive growth of web usage. To accomplish a complex task, users may
need to obtain information of various entities. For example, a user who wants
to
plan a trip to Beijing, should book a flight, reserve a hotel room, and survey
a Beijing map. A complex task thus needs to submit several queries in order to
seeking each of entities. Understanding complex tasks can allow a search engine
to suggest related entities and help users explicitly assign their ongoing
tasks.
