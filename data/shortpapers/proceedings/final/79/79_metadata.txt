Abstract#==#One fundamental problem of distant supervision is the noisy training corpus
problem. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a new distant supervision
method, called Semantic Consistency, which can identify reliable instances from
noisy instances by in-specting whether an instance is located in a semantically
consistent region. Specifically, we propose a semantic consistency model, which
first models the local subspace around an instance as a sparse linear
combination of training instances, then estimate the semantic consistency using
the characteristics of the local subspace. Experimental results verified the
effectiveness of our method.
