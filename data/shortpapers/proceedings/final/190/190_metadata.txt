Abstract#==#In this paper, we combine existing NLP techniques with minimal supervision to
build memory tips according to the keyword method, a well established mnemonic
device for second language learning. We present what we believe to be the first
extrinsic evaluation of a creative sentence generator on a vocabulary learning
task. The results demonstrate that NLP techniques can effectively support the
development of resources for second language learning.
