Abstract#==#Data selection has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to addressing
the lack of high-quality bitext for statistical machine translation in the
domain of interest. Most current data selection methods solely use language
models trained on a small scale in-domain data to select domain-relevant
sentence pairs from general-domain parallel corpus. By contrast, we argue that
the relevance between a sentence pair and target domain can be better evaluated
by the combination of language model and translation model. In this paper, we
study and experiment with novel methods that apply translation models into
domain-relevant data selection. The results show that our methods outperform
previous methods. When the selected sentence pairs are evaluated on
an end-to-end MT task, our methods can increase the translation performance by
3 BLEU points.
