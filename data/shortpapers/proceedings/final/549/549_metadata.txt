Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach to query construction to detect
  multilingual dictionaries for predetermined language combinations on
  the web, based on the identification of terms which are likely to
  occur in bilingual dictionaries but not in general web documents. We
  use eight target languages for our case study, and train our method on
  pre-identified multilingual dictionaries and the Wikipedia dump for
  each of our languages.
