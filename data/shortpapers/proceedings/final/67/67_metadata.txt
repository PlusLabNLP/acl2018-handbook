Abstract#==#We replace the overlap mechanism of the Lesk algorithm with a simple, general-
purpose Naive Bayes model that measures many-to-many association between two
sets of random variables. Even with simple probability estimates such as
maximum likelihood, the model gains significant improvement over the Lesk
algorithm on word sense disambiguation tasks. With additional lexical knowledge
from Word- Net, performance is further improved to surpass the state-of-the-art
results.
