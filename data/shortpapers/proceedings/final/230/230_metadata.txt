Abstract#==#We present an approach to cross-language retrieval that combines dense
knowledge-based features and sparse word translations. Both feature types are
learned directly from relevance rankings of bilingual documents in a pairwise
ranking framework. In large-scale experiments for patent prior art search and
cross-lingual retrieval in Wikipedia, our approach yields considerable
improvements over learning-to-rank with either only dense or only sparse
features, and over very competitive baselines that combine state-of-the-art
machine translation and retrieval.
