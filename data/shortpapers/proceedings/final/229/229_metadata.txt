Abstract#==#Dialog topic tracking aims at analyzing and maintaining topic transitions in
ongoing dialogs. This paper proposes a composite kernel approach for dialog
topic tracking to utilize various types of domain knowledge obtained from
Wikipedia.
Two kernels are defined based on history sequences and context trees
constructed based on the extracted features. The experimental results show that
our composite kernel approach can significantly improve the performances of
topic tracking in mixed-initiative human-human dialogs.
