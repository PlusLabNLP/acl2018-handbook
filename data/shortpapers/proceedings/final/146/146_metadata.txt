Abstract#==#This paper describes an application of distributional semantics to the study of
syntactic productivity in diachrony, i.e., the property of grammatical
constructions to attract new lexical items over time. By providing an empirical
measure of semantic similarity between words derived from lexical
co-occurrences, distributional semantics not only reliably captures how the
verbs in the distribution of a construction are related, but also enables the
use of visualization techniques and statistical modeling to analyze the
semantic development of a construction over time and identify the semantic
determinants of syntactic productivity in naturally occurring data.
