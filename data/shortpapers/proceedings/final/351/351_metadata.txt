Abstract#==#Segmentation of clitics has been shown to improve accuracy on a variety of
Arabic NLP tasks. However, state-of-the-art Arabic word segmenters are either
limited to formal Modern Standard Arabic, performing poorly on Arabic text
featuring dialectal vocabulary and grammar, or rely on linguistic knowledge
that is hand-tuned for each dialect. We extend an existing MSA segmenter with a
simple domain adaptation technique and new features in order to segment
informal and dialectal Arabic text. Experiments show that our system
outperforms existing systems on newswire, broadcast news and Egyptian dialect,
improving segmentation F1 score on a recently released Egyptian Arabic corpus
to 95.1%, compared to 90.8% for another segmenter designed specifically for
Egyptian Arabic.
