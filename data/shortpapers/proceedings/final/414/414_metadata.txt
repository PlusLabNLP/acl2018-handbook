Abstract#==#When a system fails to correctly recognize a voice search query, the user will
frequently retry the query, either by repeating it exactly or rephrasing it in
an attempt to adapt to the system's failure. It is desirable to be able to
identify queries as retries both offline, as a valuable quality signal, and
online, as contextual information that can aid recognition. We present a method
than can identify retries offline with 81\% accuracy using similarity measures
between two subsequent queries as well as system and user signals of 
recognition accuracy. The retry rate predicted by this method correlates
significantly with a gold standard measure of accuracy, suggesting that it may
be useful as an offline predictor of accuracy.
