Abstract#==#We present a simple joint inference of deep case analysis and zero subject
generation for the pre-ordering in Japanese-to-English machine
translation. The detection of subjects and objects from Japanese sentences is
more difficult than that from English, while it is the key process to generate
correct English word orders. In addition, subjects are often omitted in
Japanese when they are inferable from the context.We propose a new Japanese
deep syntactic parser that consists of pointwise probabilistic models and a
global inference with linguistic constraints. We applied our new deep parser to
pre-ordering in Japanese-to-English SMT system and show substantial
improvements in automatic evaluations.
