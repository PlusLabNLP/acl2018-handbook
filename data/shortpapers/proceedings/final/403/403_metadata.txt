Abstract#==#We present a study of aspects of discourse structure --- specifically discourse
devices used to organize information in a sentence --- that significantly
impact the quality of machine translation. Our analysis is based on manual
evaluations of translations of news from Chinese and Arabic to English. We find
that there is a particularly strong mismatch in the notion of what constitutes
a sentence in Chinese and English, which occurs often and is associated with
significant degradation in translation quality. Also related to lower
translation quality is the need to employ multiple explicit discourse
connectives (because, but, etc.), as well as the presence of ambiguous
discourse connectives in the English translation. Furthermore, the mismatches
between discourse expressions across languages significantly impact translation
quality.
