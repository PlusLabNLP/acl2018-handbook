Abstract#==#To support empirical study of online privacy policies, as well as tools for
users with privacy concerns, we consider the problem of aligning sections of a
thousand policy documents, based on the issues they address. We apply an
unsupervised HMM; in two new (and reusable) evaluations, we find the approach
more effective than clustering and topic models.
