Abstract#==#In order to summarize a document, it is often useful to have a background set
of documents from the domain to serve as a reference for determining new and
important information in the input document. We present a model based on
Bayesian surprise which provides an intuitive way to identify surprising
information from summarization input with respect to a background corpus.
Specifically, the method quantifies the degree to which pieces of information
in the input change one’s beliefs’ about the world represented in the
background. We develop systems for generic and update summarization based on
this idea. Our method provides competitive content selection performance with
particular advantages in the update task where systems are given a small and
topical background corpus.
