Abstract#==#We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose a
sentiment analysis solution to the problem: we aim to identify the sequence of
sentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them as
features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the
discussion as a whole. We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly
created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that
rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not. The best
model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.
