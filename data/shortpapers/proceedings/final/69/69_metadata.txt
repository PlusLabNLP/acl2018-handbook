Abstract#==#This paper presents the first results on parsing the  Penn Parsed Corpus of
 Modern British English (PPCMBE), a million-word   historical treebank with an
annotation style similar to that  of the Penn Treebank (PTB).  We describe key
features of the PPCMBE annotation style that differ from the PTB, and present
some experiments with tree transformations to better compare the results to the
PTB. First steps in parser analysis focus on problematic structures
  created by the parser.
