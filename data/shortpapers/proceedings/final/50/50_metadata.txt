Abstract#==#Distinguishing between paradigmatic relations such as synonymy, antonymy and
hypernymy is an important prerequisite in a range of NLP applications. In this
paper, we explore discourse relations as an alternative set of features to
lexico-syntactic patterns. We demonstrate that statistics over discourse
relations, collected via explicit discourse markers as proxies, can be utilized
as salient indicators for paradigmatic relations in multiple languages,
outperforming patterns in terms of recall and F1-score. In addition, we
observe that markers and patterns provide complementary information, leading to
significant classification improvements when applied in combination.
