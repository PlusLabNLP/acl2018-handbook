Abstract#==#In this study, we analyze links between edits in Wikipedia articles and turns
from their discussion page. Our motivation is to better understand implicit
details about the writing process and knowledge flow in collaboratively created
resources. Based on properties of the involved edit and turn, we have defined
constraints for corresponding edit-turn-pairs. We manually annotated a corpus
of 636 corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs. Furthermore, we
show how our data can be used to automatically identify corresponding
edit-turn-pairs. With the help of supervised machine learning, we achieve an
accuracy of .87 for this task.
