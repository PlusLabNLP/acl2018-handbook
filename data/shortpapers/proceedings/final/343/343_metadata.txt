Abstract#==#A modification of a reparameterisation of
IBM Model 2 is presented, which makes
the model more flexible, and able to model
a preference for aligning to words to either
the right or left, and take into account POS
tags on the target side of the corpus. We
show that this extension has a very small
impact on training times, while obtain-
ing better alignments in terms of BLEU
scores.
