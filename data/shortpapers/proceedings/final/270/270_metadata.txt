Abstract#==#This work fulfills sublinear time Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) in massive
scale document collections. The primary contribution is to propose a two-stage
unsupervised hashing framework which harmoniously integrates two
state-of-the-art hashing algorithms Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and
Iterative Quantization (ITQ). LSH accounts for neighbor candidate pruning,
while ITQ provides an efficient and effective reranking over the neighbor pool
captured by LSH. Furthermore, the proposed hashing framework capitalizes on
both term and topic similarity among documents, leading to precise document
retrieval. The experimental results convincingly show that our hashing based
document retrieval approach well approximates the conventional Information
Retrieval (IR) method in terms of retrieving semantically similar documents,
and meanwhile achieves a speedup of over one order of magnitude in query time.
