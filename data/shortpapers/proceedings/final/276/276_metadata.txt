Abstract#==#Recent work classifying citations in scientific literature has shown
that it is possible to improve classification results with extensive
feature engineering.  While this result confirms that citation
classification is feasible, there are two drawbacks to this
approach: (i) it requires a large annotated corpus for supervised
classification, which in the case of scientific literature is quite
expensive; and (ii) feature engineering that is too specific to one
area of scientific literature may not be portable to other domains,
even within scientific literature.  In this paper we address these
two drawbacks.                    First, we frame citation classification as a domain
adaptation task and leverage the abundant labeled data available in
other domains.                    Then, to avoid over-engineering specific citation
features for a particular scientific domain, we explore a deep
learning neural network approach that has shown to generalize well
across domains using unigram and bigram features.  We achieve better
citation classification results with this cross-domain approach than
using in-domain classification.
