Abstract#==#We propose two polynomial time inference algorithms to compress sentences under
bigram and dependency-factored objectives. The first algorithm is exact and
requires O(n^6) running time. It extends Eisner's cubic time parsing algorithm
by using virtual dependency arcs to link deleted words. Two signatures are
added to each span, indicating the number of deleted words and the rightmost
kept word within the span. The second algorithm is a fast approximation of the
first one. It relaxes the compression ratio constraint using Lagrangian
relaxation, and thereby requires O(n^4) running time. Experimental results on
the popular sentence compression corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed approach.
