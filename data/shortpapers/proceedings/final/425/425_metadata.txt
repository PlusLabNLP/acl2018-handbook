Abstract#==#This article contributes to the ongoing discussion in the computational
linguistics community regarding instances that are difficult to annotate
reliably. Is it worthwhile to identify those? What information can be inferred
from them regarding the nature of the task? What should be done with them when
building supervised machine learning systems? We address these questions in the
context of a subjective semantic task. In this setting, we show that the
presence of such instances in training data misleads a machine learner into
misclassifying clear-cut cases.  We also show that considering machine learning
outcomes with and without the difficult cases, it is possible to identify
specific weaknesses of the problem representation.
