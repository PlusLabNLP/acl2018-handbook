Abstract#==#We propose a number of refinements to the canonical approach to interactive
translation prediction. By more permissive matching criteria, placing emphasis
on matching the last word of the user prefix, and dealing with predictions to
partially typed words, we observe gains in both word prediction accuracy
(+5.4%) and letter prediction accuracy (+9.3%).
