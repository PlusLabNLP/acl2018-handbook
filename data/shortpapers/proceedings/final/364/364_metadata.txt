Abstract#==#We present a nonparametric density estimation technique for image caption
generation. Data-driven matching methods have shown to be effective for a
variety of complex problems in Computer Vision. These methods reduce an
inference problem for an unknown image to finding an existing labeled image
which is semantically similar. However, related approaches for image caption
generation (Ordonez et al., 2011; Kuznetsova et al., 2012) are hampered by
noisy estimations of visual content and poor alignment between images and
human-written captions. Our work addresses this challenge by estimating a word
frequency representation of the visual content of a query image. This allows us
to cast caption generation as an extractive summarization problem. Our model
strongly outperforms two state-of-the-art caption extraction systems according
to human judgments of caption relevance.
