Abstract#==#We investigate recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are
not explicitly expressed in syntactic structure.
While prior works addressed such relationships as an extension to semantic role
labeling, our work investigates them in the context of textual inference
scenarios.
Such scenarios provide prior information, which substantially eases the task.
We provide a large and freely available evaluation dataset for our task
setting, and propose methods to cope with it, while obtaining promising results
in empirical evaluations.
