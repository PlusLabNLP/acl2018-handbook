Abstract#==#Most approaches to incremental parsing either incur a degradation of accuracy
or they have to postpone decisions, yielding underspecified intermediate
output.  We present an incremental predictive dependency parser that is fast,
accurate, and largely language independent. By extending a state-of-the-art
dependency parser, connected analyses for sentence prefixes are obtained, which
even predict
properties and the structural embedding of upcoming words. In contrast to other
approaches, accuracy for complete sentence analyses does not decrease.
