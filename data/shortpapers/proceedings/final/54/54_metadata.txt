Abstract#==#Prior research on language identification focused primarily on text and speech.
In this paper, we focus on the visual modality and present a method for
identifying  sign languages solely from short video samples. The method is
trained on unlabelled video data (unsupervised feature learning) and using
these features, it is trained to discriminate between six  sign languages
(supervised learning). We ran experiments on short video samples involving 30
signers (about 6 hours in total). Using leave-one-signer-out cross-validation,
our evaluation shows an average best accuracy of 84%. Given that sign languages
are under-resourced, unsupervised feature learning techniques are the right
tools and our results indicate that this is realistic for  sign language
identification.
