Abstract#==#We report the first steps of a novel investigation into how a grammar induction
algorithm can be modified and used to identify salient information structures
in a corpus. The information structures are to be used as representations of
semantic content for text mining purposes.  We modify the learning regime of
the ADIOS algorithm (Solan et al., 2005) so that text is presented as
increasingly large snippets around key terms, and instances of selected
structures are substituted with common identifiers in the input for subsequent
iterations. The technique is applied to 1.4m blog posts about climate change
which mention diverse topics and reflect multiple perspectives and different
points of view. Observation of the resulting information structures suggests
that they could be useful as representations of semantic content. Preliminary
analysis shows that our modifications had a beneficial effect for inducing more
useful structures.
