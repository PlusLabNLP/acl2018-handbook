Abstract#==#This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity
translation pair discovery. Existing approach of understanding relation
equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities. In
this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding
relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent
features complement each other. Our proposed hybrid approach of using both
explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score,
and in turn
improves entity translation by 0.02.
