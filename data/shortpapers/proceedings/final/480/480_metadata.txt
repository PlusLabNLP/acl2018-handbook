Abstract#==#We present several alternative asymmetric models based on Tversky
 (1977) and show how they improve correlations with
 human similarity judgments and improve nearest neighbor discovery for both
 very frequent and very rare words.  We attribute this to a principle
 discovered by Tversky, that in comparing sparse and rich representations, the
 feature weights may be tipped in favor of recalling the features of the
 sparser representation, since improvement on our two tasks can be traced to
 improved performance when comparing mid-frequency and frequent words.
