Abstract#==#Today's event ordering research is heavily dependent on annotated corpora.
Current corpora influence shared evaluations and drive algorithm development.
Partly due to this dependence, most research focuses on partial orderings of a
document's events. For instance, the TempEval competitions and the TimeBank
only annotate small portions of the event graph, focusing on the most salient
events or on specific types of event pairs (e.g., only events in the same
sentence). Deeper temporal reasoners struggle with this sparsity because the
entire temporal picture is not represented. This paper proposes a new
annotation process with a mechanism to force annotators to label connected
graphs. It generates 10 times more relations per document than the TimeBank,
and our TimeBank-Dense corpus is larger than all current corpora. We hope this
process and its dense corpus encourages research on new global models with
deeper reasoning.
