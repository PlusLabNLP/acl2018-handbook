Abstract#==#With the proliferation of social media sites, social streams have proven to
contain the most up-to-date information on current events. Therefore, it is
crucial to extract events from the social streams such as tweets. However, it
is not straightforward to adapt the existing event extraction systems since
texts in social media are fragmented and noisy. In this paper we propose a
simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to
extract structured representation of events from social media. LEM is fully
unsupervised and does not require annotated data for training. We evaluate LEM
on a Twitter corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves
83\% of F-measure, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7%.
