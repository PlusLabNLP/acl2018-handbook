Abstract#==#Motivated by work predicting coarse-grained
author categories in social media,
such as gender or political preference,
we explore whether Twitter contains information
to support the prediction of fine-grained
categories, or social roles. We
find that the simple self-identification pattern
“I am a ___” supports significantly
richer classification than previously explored,
successfully retrieving a variety of
fine-grained roles. For a given role (e.g.,
writer), we can further identify characteristic
attributes using a simple possessive
construction (e.g., “writer’s ___”). Tweets
that incorporate the attribute terms in first
person possessives ("my ___") are confirmed
to be an indicator that the author holds the
associated social role.
