Abstract#==#A common task in qualitative data analysis is to characterize the usage of a
linguistic entity by issuing queries over syntactic relations between words.
Previous interfaces for  searching over syntactic structures require
programming-style queries. User interface research suggests that it is easier
to recognize a pattern than to compose it from scratch; therefore, interfaces
for non-experts should show previews of syntactic relations. What these
previews should look like is an open question that we explored with a
400-participant Mechanical Turk experiment. We found that syntactic relations
are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than
a baseline of naming the relations alone.  This suggests that user interfaces
should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose
between different relations.
