Abstract#==#Words undergo various changes when entering
new languages. Based on the assumption
that these linguistic changes follow certain rules,
we propose a method for automatically detecting
pairs of cognates employing an orthographic
alignment method which proved relevant for sequence
alignment in computational biology. We
use aligned subsequences as features for machine
learning algorithms in order to infer rules for linguistic
changes undergone by words when entering
new languages and to discriminate between
cognates and non-cognates. Given a list of known
cognates, our approach does not require any other
linguistic information. However, it can be customized
to integrate historical information regarding
language evolution.
