Abstract#==#In statistical machine translation (SMT), syntax-based pre-ordering of the
source language is an effective method for dealing with language pairs where
there are great differences in their respective word orders. This paper
introduces a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for
Chinese-English SMT. We present a set of dependency-based pre-ordering rules
which improved the BLEU score by 1.61 on the NIST 2006 evaluation data. We also
investigate the accuracy of the rule set by conducting human evaluations.
