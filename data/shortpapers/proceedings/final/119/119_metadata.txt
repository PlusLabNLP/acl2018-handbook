Abstract#==#Selection of information from external sources is an important skill assessed
in educational measurement. We address an integrative summarization task used
in an assessment of English proficiency for non-native speakers applying to
higher education institutions in the USA. We evaluate a variety of content
importance models that help predict which parts of the source material should
be selected by the test-taker in order to succeed on this task.
