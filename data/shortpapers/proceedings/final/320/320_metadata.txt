Abstract#==#Automated methods for identifying whether sentences are grammatical have
various potential applications (e.g., machine translation, automated essay
scoring, computer-assisted language learning).                                 In
this
work, we
construct a
statistical model of grammaticality using various linguistic features (e.g.,
misspelling counts, parser outputs, n-gram language model scores). We also
present a new publicly available dataset of learner sentences judged for
grammaticality on an ordinal scale. In evaluations, we compare our system to
the one from Post (2011) and find that our approach yields state-of-the-art
performance.
