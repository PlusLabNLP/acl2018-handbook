Abstract#==#This paper presents a method for detecting words related to a topic (we
 call them topic words) over time in the stream of documents. Topic words are
widely distributed in the stream of documents, and sometimes they
 frequently appear in the documents, and sometimes not. We propose a method to
reinforce topic words with low frequencies by collecting documents from the
corpus, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to these documents. For the
results of LDA, we identified topic words by using Moving Average Convergence
Divergence. In order to evaluate the method, we applied the results of topic
detection to extractive multi-document summarization. The results showed that
the method was effective for sentence selection in summarization.
