Abstract#==#Annotation errors can significantly hurt classifier performance, yet datasets
are only growing noisier with the increased use of Amazon Mechanical Turk and
techniques like distant supervision that automatically generate labels. In this
paper, we present a robust extension of logistic regression that incorporates
the possibility of mislabelling directly into the objective. This model can be
trained through nearly the same means as logistic regression, and retains its
efficiency on high-dimensional datasets. We conduct initial experiments on
named entity recognition data and find that our approach can provide a
significant improvement over the standard model when annotation errors are
present.
