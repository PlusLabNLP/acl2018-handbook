Abstract#==#Word embeddings learned on unlabeled data are a popular tool in semantics, but
may not capture the desired semantics. We propose a new learning objective that
incorporates both a neural language model objective (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and
prior knowledge from semantic resources to learn improved lexical semantic
embed- dings. We demonstrate that our embeddings improve over those learned
solely on raw text in three settings: language modeling, measuring semantic
similarity, and predicting human judgements.
