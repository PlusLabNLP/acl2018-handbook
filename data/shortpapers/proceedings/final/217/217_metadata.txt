Abstract#==#We introduce a generalized framework to enrich the personalized language models
for cold start users. The cold start problem is solved with content written by
friends on social network services. Our framework consists of a mixture
language model, whose mixture weights are estimated with a factor graph. The
factor graph is used to incorporate prior knowledge and heuristics to identify
the most appropriate weights. The intrinsic and extrinsic experiments show
significant improvement on cold start users.
