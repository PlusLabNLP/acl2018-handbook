Abstract#==#Creating cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias is
now an important task in the unification of multilingual knowledge bases. In
this paper, we propose a cross-language article linking method using a
mixed-language topic model and hypernym translation features based on an SVM
model to link English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike, the most widely used
Wiki-like encyclopedia in China. To evaluate our approach, we compile a data
set from the top 500 Baidu Baike articles and their corresponding English Wiki
articles.
The evaluation results show that our approach achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46%
in recall. Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and
can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different
online encyclopedias in other languages.
