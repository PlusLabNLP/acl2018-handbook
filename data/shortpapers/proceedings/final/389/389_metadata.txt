Abstract#==#Any given verb can appear in some syntactic frames (Sally broke the vase, The
vase broke) but not others (*Sally broke at the vase, Sally broke the vase to
John). There is now considerable evidence that the syntactic behaviors of some
verbs can predicted by their meanings, and many current theories posit that
this is true for most if not all verbs. If true, this fact would have striking
implications for theories and models of language acquisition, as well as
numerous applications in natural language processing. However, empirical
investigations to date have focused on a small number of verbs. We report on
early results from VerbCorner, a crowd-sourced project extending this work to a
large, representative sample of English verbs.
