Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose new algorithms for learning segmentation strategies
for simultaneous speech translation.
In contrast to previously proposed heuristic methods,
our method finds a segmentation that
directly maximizes the performance of the machine translation system.
We describe two methods based on greedy search and dynamic programming
that search for the optimal segmentation strategy.
An experimental evaluation finds that
our algorithm is able to segment the input two to three times more frequently
than conventional methods in terms of number of words, while maintaining
the same score of automatic evaluation.
