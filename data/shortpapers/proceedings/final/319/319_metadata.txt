Abstract#==#In linguistic annotation projects, we typically develop annotation guidelines
to minimize disagreement. However, in this position paper we question whether
we should actually limit the disagreements between annotators, rather than
embracing them.
We present an empirical analysis of part-of-speech annotated data sets that
suggests that disagreements are systematic across domains and to a certain
extend also across languages. This points to an underlying ambiguity rather
than random errors. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of tag confusions reveals
that the majority of disagreements are due to linguistically debatable cases
rather than annotation errors. Specifically, we show that even in the absence
of annotation guidelines only 2% of annotator choices are linguistically
unmotivated.
