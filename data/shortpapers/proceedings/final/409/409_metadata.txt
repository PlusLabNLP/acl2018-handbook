Abstract#==#Unsupervised domain adaptation often relies on transforming the instance
representation. However, most such approaches are designed for bag-of-words
models, and ignore the structured features present in many problems in NLP. We
propose a new technique called marginalized structured dropout, which exploits
feature structure to obtain a remarkably simple and efficient feature
projection. Applied to the task of fine-grained part-of-speech tagging on a
dataset of historical Portuguese, marginalized structured dropout yields
state-of-the-art accuracy while increasing speed by more than an
order-of-magnitude over previous work.
