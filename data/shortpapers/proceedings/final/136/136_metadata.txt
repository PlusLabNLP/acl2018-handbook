Abstract#==#Manually constructing a Wordnet is a difficult task, needing years of
expertsâ€™ time. As a first step to automatically construct full Wordnets, we
propose approaches to generate Wordnet synsets for languages both resource-rich
and resource-poor, using publicly available Wordnets, a machine translator
and/or a single bilingual dictionary. Our algorithms translate synsets of
existing Wordnets to a target language T, then apply a ranking method on the
translation candidates to find best translations in T. Our approaches are
applicable to any language which has at least one existing bilingual dictionary
translating from English to it.
