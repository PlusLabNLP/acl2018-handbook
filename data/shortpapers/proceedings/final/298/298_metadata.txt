Abstract#==#We show that it is possible to automatically detect machine translated text at
sentence level from monolingual corpora, using text classification methods. We
show further that the accuracy with which a 
learned classifier can detect text as machine translated is strongly correlated
with the translation quality of the machine translation system that generated
it. Finally, we offer a generic machine translation quality estimation
technique based on this approach, which does not require reference sentences.
