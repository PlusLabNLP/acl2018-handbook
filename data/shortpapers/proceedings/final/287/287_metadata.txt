Abstract#==#Distant supervision usually utilizes only unlabeled data and existing knowledge
bases to learn relation extraction models. 
However, in some cases a small amount of human labeled data is available. In
this paper, we demonstrate how a state-of-the-art
multi-instance multi-label model can be profitably modified to make use of
these reliable sentence-level labels in addition
to the relation-level distant supervision from a database. Experiments show
that our approach achieves a 13.5% increase in 
F-score and a 37% increase in area under the precision recall curve.
