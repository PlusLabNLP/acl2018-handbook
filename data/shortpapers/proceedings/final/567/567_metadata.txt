Abstract#==#When humans and artificial agents (e.g. robots) have mismatched perceptions of
the shared environment, referential communication between them becomes
difficult. To mediate perceptual differences, this paper presents a new
approach using probabilistic labeling for referential grounding. This approach
aims to integrate different types of evidence from the collaborative
referential discourse into a unified scheme. Its probabilistic labeling
procedure can generate multiple grounding hypotheses to facilitate follow-up
dialogue. Our empirical results have shown the probabilistic labeling approach
significantly outperforms a previous graph-matching approach for referential
grounding.
