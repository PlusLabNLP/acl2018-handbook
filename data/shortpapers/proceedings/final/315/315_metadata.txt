Abstract#==#A patent is a property right for an invention granted by the government to the
inventor. Patents often have a high concentration of scientific and technical
terms that are rare in everyday language. However, some scientific and
technical terms usually appear with high frequency only in one specific patent.
In this paper, we propose a pragmatic approach to Chinese word segmentation on
patents where we train a sequence labeling model based on a group of novel
document-level features. Experiments show that the accuracy of our model
reached 96.3% (F1 score) on development set and 95.0% on a held-out test set.
