Abstract#==#This paper provides a method for improving tensor-based compositional
distributional models of meaning by the addition of an explicit disambiguation
step prior to composition. In contrast with previous research where this
hypothesis has been successfully tested against relatively simple compositional
models, in our work we use a robust model trained with linear regression. The
results we get in two experiments show the superiority of the prior
disambiguation method and suggest that the effectiveness of this approach is
model-independent.
