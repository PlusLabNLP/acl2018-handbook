Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel model for enriching the content of microblogs
by exploiting external knowledge, thus improving the data sparseness problem in
short text classification. We assume that microblogs share the same topics with
external knowledge. We first build an optimization model to infer the topics of
microblogs by employing the topic-word distribution
of the external knowledge. Then the content of microblogs is further enriched
by relevant words from external knowledge. Experiments on microblog
classification show that our approach is effective and outperforms traditional
text classification methods.
