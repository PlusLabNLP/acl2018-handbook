Abstract#==#Finite-state chunking and tagging methods are very fast for annotating
non-hierarchical syntactic information, and are often applied in applications
that do not require full syntactic analyses.  Scenarios such as incremental
machine translation may benefit from some degree of hierarchical syntactic
analysis without requiring fully connected parses.  We introduce hedge parsing
as an approach to recovering constituents of length up to some maximum span L. 
This approach improves efficiency by bounding constituent size, and allows for
efficient segmentation strategies prior to parsing.  Unlike shallow parsing
methods, hedge parsing yields internal hierarchical structure of phrases within
its span bound.  We present the approach and some initial experiments on
different inference strategies.
