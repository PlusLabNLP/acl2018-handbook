Abstract#==#We develop a system that lets people overcome language barriers by letting them
speak a language they do not know.  Our system accepts text entered by a user,
translates the text, then converts the translation into a phonetic spelling in
the user's own orthography.  We trained the system on phonetic spellings in
travel phrasebooks.
