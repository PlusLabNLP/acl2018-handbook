Abstract#==#The paper describes the University of Melbourne’s
submission to the SIGMORPHON
2020 Shared Task 0: Typologically Diverse
Morphological Inflection. Our team submitted
three systems in total, two neural and one
non-neural. Our analysis of systems’ performance
shows positive effects of newly introduced
data hallucination technique that we employed
in one of neural systems, especially in
low-resource scenarios. A non-neural system
based on observed inflection patterns shows
optimistic results even in its simple implementation
(>75% accuracy for 50% of languages).
With possible improvement within the same
modeling principle, accuracy might grow to
values above 90%.
