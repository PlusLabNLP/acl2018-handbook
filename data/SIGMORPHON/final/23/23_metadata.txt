Abstract#==#We describe the NYU-CUBoulder systems for the SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 0 on typologically diverse morphological inflection and Task 2 on unsupervised morphological paradigm completion.
The former consists of generating morphological inflections from a lemma and a set of morphosyntactic features describing the target form. The latter requires generating entire paradigms for a set of given lemmas from raw text alone.
We model morphological inflection as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where the input is the sequence of the lemma's characters with morphological tags, and the output is the sequence of the inflected form's characters. 
First, we apply a transformer model to the task.
Second, as inflected forms share most characters with the lemma, we further propose a pointer-generator transformer model to allow easy copying of input characters.
