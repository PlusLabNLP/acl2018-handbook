Abstract#==#This paper presents the University of Alberta systems and results in the SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 1: Multilingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion. Following previous SIGMORPHON shared tasks, we define a low-resource setting with 100 training instances. We experiment with three transduction approaches in both standard and low-resource settings, as well as on the related task of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. We propose a method for synthesizing training data using a combination of diverse models.
