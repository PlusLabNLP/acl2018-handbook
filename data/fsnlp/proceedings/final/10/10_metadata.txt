Abstract#==#Sentiment Analysis, an important area of Natural Language Understanding, often
relies on the assumption that lexemes carry inherent sentiment values, as
reflected in specialized resources. We examine and measure the contribution
that eight intensifying adverbs make to the sentiment value of sentences, as
judged by human annotators. Our results show, first, that the intensifying
adverbs are not themselves sentiment-laden but strengthen the sentiment
conveyed by words in their contexts to different degrees. We consider the
consequences for appropriate modifications of the representation of the adverbs
in sentiment lexicons.
