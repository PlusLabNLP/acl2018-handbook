Abstract#==#Prof. Charles J. Fillmore had a life-long interest in lexical
semantics, and this culminated in the latter part of his life in a
major research project, the FrameNet Project at the International
Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California
(http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu).  This paper reports on the
background of this ongoing project, its connections to Fillmore's
other research interests, and briefly outlines applications and
current directions of growth for FrameNet, including FrameNets in
languages other than English.
