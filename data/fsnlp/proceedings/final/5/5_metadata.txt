Abstract#==#Lexical substitution is an annotation task in which annotators provide
one-word paraphrases (lexical substitutes) for individual target words
in a sentence context. Lexical substitution yields a fine-grained
characterization of
word meaning that can be done by non-expert annotators. We discuss
results of a recent lexical substitution annotation effort, where we
found strong contextual modulation effects: Many substitutes were not synonyms,
hyponyms or hypernyms
of the targets, but were highly specific to the situation at
hand. This data provides some food for thought for frame-semantic
analysis.
