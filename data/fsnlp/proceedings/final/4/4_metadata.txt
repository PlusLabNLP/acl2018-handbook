Abstract#==#We present a brief history and overview of statistical methods in
frame-semantic
 parsing -- the automatic analysis of text using the theory of frame
 semantics. We discuss how the FrameNet lexicon and frame-annotated
 datasets have been used by statistical NLP researchers to build
 usable, state-of-the-art systems. We also focus on future directions in
 frame-semantic parsing research, and discuss NLP applications that could
benefit
 from this line of work.
