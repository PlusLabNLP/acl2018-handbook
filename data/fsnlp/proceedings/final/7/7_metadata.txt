Abstract#==#FrameNet is the best currently operational
version of Chuck Fillmoreâ€™s Frame Semantics.
As FrameNet has evolved over
the years, we have been building a series
of increasingly ambitious prototype
systems that exploit FrameNet as a semantic
resource. Results from this work
point to frames as a natural representation
for applications that require linking textual
meaning to world knowledge.
