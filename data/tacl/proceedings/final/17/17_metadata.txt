Abstract#==#Greedy transition-based parsers are very fast but tend to suffer from error
propagation. This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally
trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that
they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only
valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we
give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and
complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems
that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method
for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these
oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative
and nonoptimal paths during training â€“ in contrast to oracles that statically
assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data
sets clearly shows that using dynamic oracles to train greedy parsers gives
substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no
cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search.
