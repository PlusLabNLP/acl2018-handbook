Abstract#==#We develop parsing oracles for two transition-based dependency parsers,
including the arc-standard parser, solving a problem that was left open in
(Goldberg and Nivre, 2013). We experimentally show that using these oracles in
training yields superior parsing accuracies on many languages.
