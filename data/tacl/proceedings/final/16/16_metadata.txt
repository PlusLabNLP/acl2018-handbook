Abstract#==#In this paper, we present heterogeneous networks as a way to unify 
lexical networks with relational data. We build a unified ACL Anthology
network, tying together the citation, author collaboration, and
term-cooccurence networks with affiliation and venue relations. This
representation proves to be convenient and allows problems such as name
disambiguation, topic modeling, and the measurement of scientific impact to be
easily solved using only this network and off-the-shelf graph algorithms.
