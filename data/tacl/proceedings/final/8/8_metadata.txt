Abstract#==#Entity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) both address 
the lexical ambiguity of language. But while the two tasks are pretty similar,
they differ in a fundamental aspect: in EL the textual mention can be linked to
an entity which may or may not contain the exact mention, while in WSD there is
a perfect match between the word form (better, its lemma) and a suitable sense.

In this paper we present a unified graph-based approach to EL and WSD based on
a loose identification of candidate meanings coupled with a densest subgraph
heuristic which selects high-coherence semantic interpretations. Our
experiments show state-of-the-art performances on both tasks on four different
datasets, including a multilingual setting.
