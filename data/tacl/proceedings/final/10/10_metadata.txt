Abstract#==#We present a large scale study of the languages spoken by bilingual workers on
Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We establish a methodology for determining the
language skills of anony- mous crowd workers that is more robust than simple
surveying. 
We validate workersâ€™ self- reported language skill claims by measuring their
ability to correctly translate words, and by geolocating workers to see if they
reside in countries where the languages are likely to be spoken. Rather than
posting a one-off survey, we posted paid tasks consisting of 1,000 as-
signments to translate a total of 10,000 words in each of 100 languages. Our
study ran for several months, and was highly visible on the MTurk crowdsourcing
platform,
increas- ing the chances that bilingual workers would complete it. Our study
was useful both to cre- ate bilingual dictionaries and to act as cen- sus of
the bilingual speakers on MTurk. We use this data to recommend languages with
the largest speaker populations as good candidates for other researchers who
want to develop crowdsourced, multilingual technologies. To further demonstrate
the value of creating data via crowdsourcing, we hire workers to create
bilingual parallel corpora in six Indian lan- guages, and use them to train
statistical
ma- chine translation systems.
