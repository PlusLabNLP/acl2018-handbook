Abstract#==#We present a simple, easy-to-replicate monolingual aligner that 
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while relying on almost no
supervision and a very small number of external resources. Based on the
hypothesis that words with similar meanings represent potential pairs for
alignment if located in similar contexts, we propose a system that operates by
finding such pairs.In two intrinsic evaluations on alignment test data, our
system achieves \textit{F}$_{1}$ scores of 88--92\%, demonstrating 1--3\%
absolute improvement over the previous best system. Moreover, in two extrinsic
evaluations our aligner outperforms existing aligners, and even a naive
application of the aligner approaches state-of-the-art performance at each
extrinsic task.
