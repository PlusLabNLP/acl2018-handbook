Abstract#==#Sentiment-oriented multi-relation extraction from user-generated web 
documents is of great importance for both producers and consumers. Unlike the
previous work, we formulate this extraction task as a learning problem with
structured outputs and design the corresponding inference as an integer linear
program.  Our newly proposed model based on latent structural SVM can learn
from the training corpora, which does not contain explicit annotations of
sentiment-bearing expressions, and it can simultaneously recognize both binary
(opinion) and ternary (comparison) relations with regard to entity mentions of
interest. The empirical evaluation shows that our approach significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across domains (camera and movie)
and across genres (reviews and forum posts). The gold standard corpus will also
be a valuable resource for the community.
