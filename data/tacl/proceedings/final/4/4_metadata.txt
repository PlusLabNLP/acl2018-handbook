Abstract#==#We present FLORS, a new part-of-speech tagger for domain adaptation. 
FLORS uses robust representations that work especially well for unknown words
and for known words with unseen tags. FLORS is simpler and faster than previous
domain adaptation methods, yet it has significantly better accuracy than
several baselines.
