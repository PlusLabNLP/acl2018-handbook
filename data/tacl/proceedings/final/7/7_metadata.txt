Abstract#==#Stress has long been established as a major cue in word segmentation 
for English infants. We show that enabling a current state-of-the-artBayesian
word segmentation model to take advantage of stress cuesnoticeably improves its
performance. We find that the improvementsrange from 10 to 4%, depending on
both the use of phonotactic cuesand, to a lesser extent, the amount of evidence
available to the learner.We also find that in particular early on, stress cues
are much moreuseful for our model than phonotactic cues by themselves,
consistent with the finding that children do seem to use stress cues before
they use phonotactic cues. Finally, we study how the model's knowledge about
stress patterns evolves over time. We not only find that our model correctly
acquires the most frequent patterns relatively quickly but also that the Unique
Stress Constraint that is at the heart of a previously proposed model does not
need to be built in but can be acquired jointly with word segmentation.
