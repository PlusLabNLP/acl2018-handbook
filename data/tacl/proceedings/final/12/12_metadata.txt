Abstract#==#Features over grandparents and siblings have greatly improved the accuracy of
projective parsers, but have so far required large increases in complexity when
applied to arborescences or mildly non-projective models. We introduce a
“crossing-sensitive” generalization of the third-order factorization of Koo
and Collins (2010) that trades off complexity in the model structure (i.e.
scoring with features over pairs and triples of edges) with complexity in the
output structure (i.e. producing crossing edges). When applied to a projective
tree, the crossing-sensitive factorization exactly simplifies to Koo and
Collins’ 
Grand-Sibling model. Under this model, the optimal 1-Endpoint-Crossing tree
(Pitler et al., 2013) can be found in O(n^4) time, matching the asymptotic
run-time of both the third- order projective parser and the edge-factored
1-Endpoint-Crossing parser. The crossing- sensitive third-order parser is
significantly more accurate than the third-order projective parser under many
experimental settings and significantly less accurate on none. Besides the
asymptotic guarantees, the cost of running the crossing-sensitive third-order
parser is low in practice, running at 0.37-0.47 times the speed of the
third-order projective parser.
