Abstract#==#We present a novel representation, evaluation measure, and supervised 
models for the task of identifying the multiword expressions (MWEs) in a
sentence, resulting in a lexical semantic segmentation. Our approach
generalizes a standard chunking  representation to encode a subset of
projective MWEs containing  gaps, thereby enabling efficient sequence tagging
algorithms for feature-rich discriminative models. Experiments on a new dataset
of English web text offer the first linguistically-driven evaluation of MWE
identification with truly heterogeneous expression types. Our statistical
sequence model greatly outperforms a lookup-based segmentation procedure,
achieving 60% F1 for MWE identification.
