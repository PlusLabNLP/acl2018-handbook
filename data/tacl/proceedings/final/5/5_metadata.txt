Abstract#==#We present an incremental dependency parsing model that jointly
performsdisfluency detection.  The model handles speech repairs using a novel
non-monotonictransition system, and includes several novel classes of features.

Together, these additions improve parse accuracy by 1%.  The model runs in
expected linear time, and processes over 700 sentences a second.
For comparison, we evaluated two pipeline systems, using state-of-the-art
disfluencydetectors.  The joint model performed better on both tasks,with a
parse accuracy of 90.5% and 84.0% accuracy at disfluency detection.
