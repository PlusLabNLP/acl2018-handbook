Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the problem of manually correcting automatic 
annotations of natural language in as efficient a manner as possible. We
introduce a method for automatically segmenting a corpus into chunks such that
many uncertain labels are grouped into the same chunk, while human supervision
can be omitted altogether for other segments. A tradeoff must be found for
segment sizes. Choosing short segments allows us to reduce the number of highly
confident labels that are supervised by the annotator, which is useful because
these labels are often already correct and supervising correct labels is a
waste of effort. In contrast, long segments reduce the cognitive effort due to
context switches. Our method helps find the segmentation that optimizes
supervision efficiency by defining user models to predict the cost and utility
of supervising each segment and solving a constrained optimization problem
balancing these contradictory objectives. A user study demonstrates substantial
gains over pre-segmented, confidence-ordered baselines on two natural language
processing tasks: speech transcription and word segmentation.
