Abstract#==#We propose to use the visual denotations of linguistic expressions (i.e. the
set of images they describe) to define novel denotational similarity metrics,
which we show to be at least as beneficial as distributional similarities for
two tasks that require semantic inference. To compute these denotational
similarities, we construct a denotation graph, i.e. a subsumption hierarchy
over constituents and their denotations, based on a large corpus of 30K images
and 150K descriptive captions.
