Abstract#==#Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these 
models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing
and classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous
models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the
DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space
in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike
previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus
on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from
the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other
recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words
baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and
vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that
describe the same image.
