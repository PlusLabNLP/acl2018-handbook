Abstract#==#This article discusses the requirements of a formal specification for the
annotation of tem- poral information in clinical narratives. We discuss the
implementation and extension of ISO-TimeML for annotating a corpus of clini-
cal notes, known as the XXX corpus. To reflect the information task and the
heavily
inference- based reasoning demands in the domain, a new annotation guideline
has been developed, “the XXX Guidelines to ISO-TimeML (XXX- TimeML)”. To
clarify what relations merit an- notation, we distinguish between
linguistically- derived and inferentially-derived temporal or- derings in the
text. We also apply a top per- forming TempEval 2013 system against this new
resource to measure the difficulty of adapt- ing systems to the clinical
domain. The corpus is available to the community and has been proposed for use
in a SemEval 2015 task.
