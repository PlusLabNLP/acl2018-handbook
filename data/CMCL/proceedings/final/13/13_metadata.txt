Abstract#==#The representations and processes yielding the limited length and telegraphic
style of language production early on in acquisition have received little
attention in acquisitional modeling. In this paper, we present a model,
starting with minimal linguistic representations, that incrementally builds up
an inventory of increasingly long and abstract grammatical representations
(form+meaning pairings), in line with the usage-based conception of language
acquisition. We explore its performance on a comprehension and a generation
task, showing that, over time, the model better understands the processed
utterances, generates longer utterances, and better expresses the situation
these utterances intend to refer to.
