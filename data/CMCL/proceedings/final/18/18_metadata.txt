Abstract#==#The ability of children to generalize over the linguistic input they
  receive is key to acquiring productive knowledge of verbs.  Such
  generalizations help children extend their learned knowledge of
  constructions to a novel verb, and use it appropriately in syntactic
  patterns previously unobserved for that verb---a key factor in
  language productivity.  Computational models can help shed light on
  the gradual development of more abstract knowledge during verb
  acquisition. We present an incremental Bayesian model that simultaneously and
  incrementally learns argument structure constructions and verb
  classes given naturalistic language input.  We show how the
  distributional properties in the input language influence the
  formation of generalizations over the constructions and classes.
