Abstract#==#We outline four ways in which uncertainty might affect comprehension difficulty
in human sentence processing. These four hypotheses motivate a self-paced
reading experiment, in which we used verb sub- categorization distributions to
manipulate the uncertainty over the next step in the syntactic derivation
(single step entropy) and the surprisal of the verbâ€™s comple- ment. We
additionally estimate word- by-word surprisal and total entropy over parses of
the sentence using a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). Surprisal and
total entropy, but not single step en- tropy, were significant predictors of
read- ing times in different parts of the sen- tence. This suggests that a
complete model of sentence processing should incorporate both entropy and
surprisal.
