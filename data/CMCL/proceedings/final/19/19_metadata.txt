Abstract#==#The salience of an entity in the discourse
is correlated with the type of referring expression
that speakers use to refer to that
entity. Speakers tend to use pronouns to
refer to salient entities, whereas they use
lexical noun phrases to refer to less salient
entities. We propose a novel approach to
formalize the interaction between salience
and choices of referring expressions using
topic modeling, focusing specifically
on the notion of topicality. We show that
topic models can capture the observation
that topical referents are more likely to be
pronominalized. This lends support to theories
of discourse salience that appeal to
latent topic representations and suggests
that topic models can capture aspects of
speakers’ cognitive representations of entities
in the discourse.
