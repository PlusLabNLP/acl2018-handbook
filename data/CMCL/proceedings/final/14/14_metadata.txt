Abstract#==#Recently a new kind of top-down parser for Minimalist grammars has been
presented in Stabler (2011, 2011). In order to determine these psycholinguistic
predictions of the parser, however, a linking hypothesis is needed that
connects the behavior of the parser to a processing difficulty metric. Kobele
et al. (2012) propose that the difficulty of sentence s correlates with the
maximum number of parse steps the parser has to keep a parse item in memory
while processing s. This metric is called maximum tenure. In this paper, we
show that maximum tenure does not make the right predictions for several
phenomena involving relative clauses and left embedding. We present a number of
alternative measures and conclude that the best (albeit not perfect) metric is
the maximum tenure of pronounced leafs in the parse tree.
