Abstract#==#Eye-movements in reading exhibit frequency spillover effects: fixation
durations on a word are affected by the frequency of the previous word. We
explore the idea that this effect may be an emergent property of a
computationally rational eye-movement strategy that is navigating a tradeoff
between processing immediate perceptual input, and continued processing of past
input based on memory. We present an adaptive eye-movement control model with a
minimal capacity for such processing, based on a composition of thresholded
sequential samplers that integrate information from noisy perception and noisy
memory.  The model is applied to the List Lexical Decision Task and shown to
yield frequency spillover -- a robust property of human eye-movements in this
task, even with parafoveal masking.  We show that spillover in the model
emerges in approximately optimal control policies that sometimes process memory
rather than perception. We compare this model with one that is able to give
priority to perception over memory, and show that the perception-priority
policies in such a model do not perform as well in a range of plausible noise
settings.  We explain how the frequency spillover arises from a
counter-intuitive but fundamental property of sequenced thresholded samplers.
