Abstract#==#This paper presents a vectorial incremental parsing model defined using
independently posited operations over activation-based working memory and
weight-based episodic memory.  This model has the attractive property that it
hypothesizes only one unary preterminal rule application and only one binary
branching rule application per time step, which allows it to be smoothly
integrated into a vector-based recurrence that propagates structural ambiguity
from one time step to the next.  Predictions of this model are calculated on a
center-embedded sentence processing task and shown to exhibit decreased
processing accuracy in center-embedded constructions.
