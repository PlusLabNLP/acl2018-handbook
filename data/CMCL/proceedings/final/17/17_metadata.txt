Abstract#==#Previous studies of alignment have focused on two-party conversations.               
     

We study multi-party conversation in online health communities, which have
shown
benefits for their members from forum conversations.  So far, our understanding
of the relationship between alignment in such multi-party conversations and its
possible connection to member benefits has been limited.  This paper quantifies
linguistic alignment in the oldest and the largest cancer online forum.  
Alignment at lexical and syntactic levels, as well as decay of alignment was
observed in forum threads, although the decay was slower than commonly found in
psycholinguistic studies. The different pattern of adaptation to the initial
post on a thread suggests that specific roles in the online forum (e.g.,
seeking support from the community) can potentially be revealed through
alignment theory and its extensions.
