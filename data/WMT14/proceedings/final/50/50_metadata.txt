Abstract#==#This paper describes the Dublin City University
terminology translation system used for our participation in the query
translation subtask in the medical translation task in the Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT14).  We deployed six different
kinds of terminology extraction methods, and participated in three
different tasks: FR--EN and 
EN--FR query tasks, and the CLIR task.              We obtained 36.2 BLEU points
absolute for FR--EN and 28.8 BLEU points absolute for EN--FR tasks where
we obtained the first place in both tasks.  We obtained 51.8
BLEU points absolute for the CLIR task.
