Abstract#==#We present the IMS-TTT submission to WMT14, an experimental statistical
tree-to-tree machine translation system based on the multi-bottom up tree
transducer including rule extraction, tuning and decoding.  Thanks to input
parse forests and a ``no pruning'' strategy during decoding, the obtained
translations are competitive.  The drawbacks are a restricted coverage of 70\%
on test data, in part due to exact input parse tree matching, and a relatively
high runtime.  Advantages include easy redecoding with a different weight
vector, since the full translation forests can be stored after the first
decoding pass.
