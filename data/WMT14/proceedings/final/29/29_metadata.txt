Abstract#==#This paper presents the use of consensus among Machine Translation (MT) systems
for the WMT14 Quality Estimation shared task. Consensus is explored here by
comparing the MT system output against several alternative machine translations
using standard evaluation metrics. Figures extracted from such metrics are used
as features to complement baseline prediction models. The hypothesis is that
knowing whether the translation of interest is similar or dissimilar to
translations from multiple different MT systems can provide useful information
regarding the quality of such a translation.
