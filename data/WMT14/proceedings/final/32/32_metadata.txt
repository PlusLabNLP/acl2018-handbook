Abstract#==#This paper describes the AFRL statistical MT system and the improvements that
were developed during the WMT14 evaluation campaign. As part of these efforts
we experimented with a number of extensions to the standard phrase-based model
that improve performance on Russian to English and Hindi to English translation
tasks. In addition, we describe our efforts to make use of monolingual English
speakers to correct the output of machine translation, and present the results
of monolingual postediting of the entire 3003 sentences of the WMT14
Russian-English test set.
