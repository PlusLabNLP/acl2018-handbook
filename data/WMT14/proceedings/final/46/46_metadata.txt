Abstract#==#Scalable discriminative training methods are now broadly available
for estimating phrase-based, feature-rich translation models. However,
the sparse feature sets typically appearing in research evaluations are less
attractive than standard dense features such as language and translation
model probabilities: they often overfit, do not generalize, or require
complex and slow feature extractors. This paper introduces extended
features, which are more specific than dense features yet more general
than lexicalized sparse features. Large-scale experiments
show that extended features yield robust BLEU gains for both Arabic-English
+1.05 and Chinese-English +0.67 relative to a strong
feature-rich baseline. We also specialize the feature set to specific
data domains, identify an objective function that is less prone to
overfitting, and release fast, scalable, and language-independent
tools for implementing the features.
