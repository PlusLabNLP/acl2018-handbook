Abstract#==#This paper explores a number of simple and effective techniques to adapt
statistical machine translation (SMT) systems in the medical domain.
Comparative experiments are conducted on large corpora for six language pairs.
We not only compare each adapted system with the baseline, but also combine
them to further improve the domain-specific systems. Finally, we attend the
WMT2014 medical summary sentence translation constrained task and our systems
achieve the best BLEU scores for Czech-English, English-German, French-English
language pairs and the second best BLEU scores for reminding pairs.
