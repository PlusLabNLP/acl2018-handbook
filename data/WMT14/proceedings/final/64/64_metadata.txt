Abstract#==#This paper describes a machine translation metric submitted to
the WMT14 Metrics Task. It is a simple modification of the standard BLEU
metric using a monolingual alignment of reference and test sentences.
The alignment is computed as a minimum weighted maximum bipartite matching
of the translated and the reference sentence words with respect to the
relative edit distance of the word prefixes and suffixes. The aligned
words are included in the $n$-gram precision computation with a penalty
proportional to the matching distance. The proposed tBLEU metric is designed to
be more tolerant to errors in inflection, which usually does not effect the
understandability of a sentence, and therefore be more suitable for measuring
quality of translation into morphologically richer languages.
