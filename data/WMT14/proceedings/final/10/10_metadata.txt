Abstract#==#This paper describes the joined submission of LIMSI and KIT to the Shared
Translation Task for the German-to-English direction.  The system consists of a
phrase-based translation system using a pre-reordering approach. The baseline
system already includes several models like conventional language models on
different word factors and a discriminative word lexicon. This system is used
to generate a k-best list. In a second step, the list is reranked using SOUL
language and translation models. 
Originally, SOUL translation models were applied to n-gram-based translation
systems that use tuples as translation units instead of phrase pairs. In this
article, we describe their integration into the KIT phrase-based system.
Experimental results show that their use can yield significant improvements in
terms of BLEU score.
