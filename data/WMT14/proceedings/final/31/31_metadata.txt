Abstract#==#In this paper we present VERTa, a linguistically-motivated metric that
combines linguistic features at different levels. We provide the linguistic
motivation on which the metric is based, as well as describe the different
modules in VERTa and how they are combined. Finally, we describe the two
versions of VERTa, VERTa-EQ and VERTa-W, sent to WMT14 and report results
obtained in the experiments conducted with the WMT12 and WMT13 data into
English.
