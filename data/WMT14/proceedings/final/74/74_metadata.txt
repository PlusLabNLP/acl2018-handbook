Abstract#==#This paper describes the UPC submissions to the WMT14 Metrics Shared Task: UPC-
IPA and UPC-STOUT. These metrics use a collection of evaluation measures
integrated in ASIYA , a toolkit for machine translation evaluation. In addition
to some standard metrics, the two submissions take advantage of novel metrics
that consider linguistic structures, lexical relationships, and semantics to
compare both source and reference translation against the candidate
translation. The new metrics are available for several target languages other
than English. In the the official WMT14 evaluation, UPC-IPA and UPC-STOUT
scored above the average in 7 out of 9 language pairs at the system level and 8
out of 9 at the segment level.
