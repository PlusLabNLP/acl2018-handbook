Abstract#==#Scrambling is acceptable reordering of
verb arguments in languages such as
Japanese and German. In automatic evaluation
of translation quality, BLEU is
the de facto standard method, but BLEU
has only very weak correlation with human
judgements in case of Japanese-to-
English/English-to-Japanese translations.
Therefore, alternative methods, IMPACT
and RIBES, were proposed and they have
shown much stronger correlation than
BLEU. Now, RIBES is popular in recent
papers on JE/EJ translations. RIBES compares
word order of MT output with manually
translated reference sentences and
does not regard scrambling at all. In this
paper, we present a method to enumerate
scrambled sentences from dependency
trees of reference sentences. Our experiments
based on NTCIR Patent MT data show that the method improves
sentence-level correlation between RIBES and
human-judged adequacy.
