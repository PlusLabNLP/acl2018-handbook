Abstract#==#We present the UvA-ILLC submission of the BEER metric to WMT 14 metrics task.
BEER is a sentence level metric that can incorporate a large number 
of features combined in a linear model. Novel contributions are (1) efficient
tuning of a large number of features for maximizing correlation with human
system ranking, and (2) novel features that  give smoother sentence level
scores.
