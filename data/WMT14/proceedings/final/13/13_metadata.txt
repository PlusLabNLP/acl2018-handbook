Abstract#==#This paper describes Parmesan, our submission to the 2014 Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) metrics task for evaluation
English-to-Czech translation. 
We show that the Czech Meteor Paraphrase tables are so noisy that they actually
can harm the performance of the metric. However, they can be very useful after
extensive filtering in targeted paraphrasing of Czech reference sentences prior
to the evaluation.
Parmesan first performs targeted paraphrasing of reference sentences, then it
computes the Meteor score using only the exact match on these new reference
sentences. It shows significantly higher correlation with human judgment than
Meteor on the WMT12 and WMT13 data.
