Abstract#==#This paper describes the University of Edinburgh's (UEDIN) phrase-based
submissions to the translation and medical translation shared tasks of the 2014
Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT). We participated in all
language pairs.  We have improved upon our 2013 system by i) using generalized 
             representations, specifically automatic word clusters for
translations out of English, ii) using unsupervised character-based models to
translate unknown words in Russian-English and Hindi-English pairs, iii)
synthesizing Hindi data from closely-related Urdu data, and iv) building huge
language on the common crawl corpus.
