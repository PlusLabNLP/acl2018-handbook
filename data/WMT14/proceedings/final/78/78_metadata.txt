Abstract#==#In this paper we describe experiments on predict HTER, as part of our
submission in the Shared Task on Quality  Estimation, in the frame of the 9th
Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. In our experiment we unsucessfully
check whether it is possible to achieve better HTER prediction by training 4
individual regression models for each one of the edit types (deletions,
insertions, substitutions, shifts). We also had no improvements when
investigating the possibility of adding more data from other minimally
post-edited and freely translated datasets.
