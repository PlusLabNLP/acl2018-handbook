Abstract#==#Despite its potential to improve lexical selection, most state-of-the-art
machine translation systems take only minimal contextual information into
account. We capture context with a topic model over distributional proÔ¨Åles
built from the context words of each translation unit. Topic distributions are
inferred for each translation unit and used to adapt the translation model
dynamically to a given test context by measuring their similarity. We show that
combining information from both local and global test contexts helps to improve
lexical selection and outperforms a baseline system by up to 1.15 BLEU. We test
our topic-adapted model on a diverse data set containing documents from three
different domains and achieve competitive performance in comparison with two
supervised domain-adapted systems.
