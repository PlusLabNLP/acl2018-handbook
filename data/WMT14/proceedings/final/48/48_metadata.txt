Abstract#==#In previous work we showed that when using an SMT model trained on old-domain
data to translate text in a new-domain, most errors are due to unseen source
words, unseen target translations, and inaccurate translation model scores
(Irvine et al., 2013a). In this work, we target errors due to inaccurate
translation model scores using new-domain comparable corpora, which we mine
from Wikipedia. We assume that we have access to a large old-domain parallel
training corpus but only enough new-domain parallel data to tune model
parameters and do evaluation. We use the new-domain comparable corpora to
estimate additional feature scores over the phrase pairs in our baseline
models. Augmenting models with the new features improves the quality of machine
translations in the medical and science domains by up to 1.3 BLEU points over
very strong baselines trained on the 150 million word Canadian Hansard dataset.
