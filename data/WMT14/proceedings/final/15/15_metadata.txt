Abstract#==#This paper describes adapting statistical machine translation (SMT) systems to
medical domain using in-domain and general-domain data as well as web-crawled
in-domain resources. In order to complement the limited in-domain corpora, we
apply domain focused web-crawling approaches to acquire in-domain monolingual
data and bilingual lexicon from the Internet. The collected data is used for
adapting the language model and translation model to boost the overall
translation quality. Besides, we propose an alternative filtering approach to
clean the crawled data and to further optimize the domain-specific SMT system.
We attend the medical summary sentence unconstrained translation task of the
Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT2014). Our systems
achieve the second best BLEU scores for Czech-English, fourth for
French-English, English-French language pairs and the third best results for
reminding pairs.
