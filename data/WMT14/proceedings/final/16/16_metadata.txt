Abstract#==#This paper describes LIMSI participation to the WMT'14 Shared Task
  on Quality Estimation; we took part to the word-level quality
  estimation task for English to Spanish translations. Our system
  relies on a random forest classifier, an ensemble method that has
  been shown to be very competitive for this kind of task, when only a
  few dense and continuous features are used.  Notably, only 16
  features are used in our experiments. These features describe, on
  the one hand, the quality of the association between the source
  sentence and each target word and, on the other hand, the fluency of
  the hypothesis. Since the evaluation criterion is the F1 measure, a
  specific tuning strategy is proposed to select the optimal values
  for the hyper-parameters. Overall, our system achieves a 0.67 F1
  score on a randomly extracted test set.
