Abstract#==#This paper describes one of the collaborative efforts within EU-BRIDGE to
further advance the state of the art in machine translation between two
European language pairs, German to English and English to German. Three
research institutes involved in the EU-BRIDGE project combined their individual
machine translation systems and participated with a joint setup in the shared
translation task of the evaluation campaign at the ACL 2014 Eighth Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2014).

We combined up to nine different machine translation engines via system
combination. RWTH Aachen University, the University of Edinburgh, and Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology  developed several individual systems which serve as
system combination input. We devoted special attention to building syntax-based
systems and combining them with the phrase-based ones. The joint setups yield
empirical gains of up to 1.6 points in BLEU and 1.0 points in TER on the WMT
newstest2013 test set compared to the best single systems.
