Abstract#==#This paper describes Dublin City University's (DCU) submission to the WMT 2014
Medical Summary task. We report our results on the test data set in the French
to English translation direction. We also report statistics collected from the
corpora used to train our translation system. We conducted our experiment on
the Moses 1.0 phrase-based translation system framework. We performed a variety
of experiments on translation models, reordering models, operation 
sequence model and language model. We also experimented with data selection and
removal the length constraint for phrase-pair extraction.
