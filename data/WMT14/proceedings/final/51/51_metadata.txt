Abstract#==#we propose new automatic evaluation metric for machine translation. Our metric
is based on chunk between reference and candidate translation. Moreover, we
apply a prize based on sentence-length to the metric, not like a penalty in
BLEU and NIST. We call this metric Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation
that Prize is Applied to Chunk-based metric (APAC). Through meta-evaluation
experiments, we confirmed that our metric is obtained the stable correlation
with human judgment among some metrics.
