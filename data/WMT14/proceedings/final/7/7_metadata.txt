Abstract#==#This paper describes Meteor Universal, released for the 2014 ACL Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation.  Meteor Universal brings language
specific evaluation to previously unsupported target languages by
(1) automatically extracting linguistic resources (paraphrase tables and
function word lists) from the bitext used to train MT systems and (2) using a
universal parameter set learned from pooling human judgments of translation
quality from several language directions.  Meteor Universal is shown to
significantly outperform baseline BLEU on a new language  (WMT13 Russian) and
is evaluated on another new language, Hindi, as part of WMT14.
