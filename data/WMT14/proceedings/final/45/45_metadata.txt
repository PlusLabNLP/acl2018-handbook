Abstract#==#We present a new version of Phrasal, an open-source toolkit for statistical
phrase-based machine translation. This revision includes features
that support emerging research trends such as (a) tuning with large
feature sets, (b) tuning on large datasets like the bitext, and (c)
web-based interactive machine translation. A direct comparison with Moses shows
favorable results in terms of decoding speed and tuning time.
