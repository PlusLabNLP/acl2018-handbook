Abstract#==#This paper describes the string-to-tree systems built at the University of
Edinburgh for the WMT 2014 shared translation task.  We developed systems for
English-German, Czech-English, French-English, German-English, Hindi-English,
and Russian-English.  This year we improved our English-German system through
target-side compound splitting, morphosyntactic constraints, and refinements to
parse tree annotation; we addressed the out-of-vocabulary problem using
transliteration for Hindi and Russian and using morphological reduction for
Russian; we improved our German-English system through tree binarization; and
we reduced system development time by filtering the tuning sets.
