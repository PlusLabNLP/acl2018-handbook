Abstract#==#This paper describes the Yandex School of Data Analysis Russian-English system
submitted to the ACL 2014 Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
shared translation task. We start with the system that we developed last year
and investigate a few methods that were successful at the previous translation
task including the new reparameterization of IBM Model 2, unpruned language
model and operation sequence model. Next we propose a {simple yet practical}
algorithm to transform Russian sentence into a more easily translatable form
before decoding. The algorithm is based on the linguistic intuition of
Russian-English bilinguals.
