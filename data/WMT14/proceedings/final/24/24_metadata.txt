Abstract#==#In phrase-based statistical machine translation systems, variation in
grammatical structures between source and target languages can cause large
movements of phrases. Modeling such movements is crucial in achieving
translations of long sentences that appear natural in the target language. We
explore generative learning approach to phrase reordering in Arabic to English.
Formulating the reordering problem as a classification problem and using naive
Bayes with feature selection, we achieve an improvement in the BLEU score over
a lexicalized reordering model. The proposed model is compact, fast and
scalable to a large corpus.
