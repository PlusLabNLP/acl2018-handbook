Abstract#==#We describe the PBSMT system and QT system that are developed for summary
translation and query translation of WMT 14 medical translation task. We focus
on query translation and propose a novel approach that divides a query into
single phrases, and finds query translation candidates for each phrase
according to three cases based on the term-to-term translation dictionary. The
result of query translation experiment shows that our novel approach obtained
higher translation accuracy than the baseline (PBSMT) system.
