Abstract#==#We present our English-Czech and English-Hindi submissions for this year's WMT
translation task. For English-Czech, we build upon last year's Chimera and
evaluate several setups. English-Hindi is a new language pair for this year. We
experimented with reverse self-training to acquire more (synthetic) parallel
data and with modeling target-side morphology.
