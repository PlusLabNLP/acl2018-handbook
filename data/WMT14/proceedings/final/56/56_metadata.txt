Abstract#==#We use parallel FDA5, an efficiently parameterized and optimized implementation
of 
feature decay algorithms for fast deployment of accurate statistical
machine translation systems, taking only about half a day for each translation
direction.
We build Parallel FDA5 Moses SMT systems for all language pairs in the WMT14
translation task and obtain SMT 
performance close to the top Moses systems with an average of $3.49$ BLEU
points difference using significantly less resources for 
training and development.
