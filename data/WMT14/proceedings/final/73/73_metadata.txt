Abstract#==#This paper describes our Word-level QE system for WMT 2014 shared task on
Spanish - English pair. Compared to WMT 2013, this yearâ€™s task is different
due to the lack of SMT setting information and additional resources. We report
how we overcome this challenge to retain most of the important features which
performed well last year in our system. Novel features related to availability
of multiple systems output (new point of this year) are also proposed and
experimented along with baseline set. The system is optimized by several ways:
tuning the classification threshold, combining with WMT 2013 data, and refining
using Feature Selection strategy on our development set, before dealing with
the test set for submission.
