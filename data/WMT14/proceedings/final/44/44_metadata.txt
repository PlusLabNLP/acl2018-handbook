Abstract#==#In this work, we tackle the problem of language and translation models
domain-adaptation without explicit bilingual in-domain training data. In such a
scenario, the only information about the domain can be induced from the
source-language test corpus. We explore unsupervised adaptation, where the
source-language test corpus is combined with the corresponding hypotheses
generated by the translation system to perform adaptation. We compare
unsupervised adaptation to supervised and pseudo supervised adaptation. 

Our results show that the choice of the adaptation (target) set is crucial for
successful application of adaptation methods. Evaluation is conducted over the
German-to-English WMT newswire translation task. The experiments show that the
unsupervised adaptation method generates the best translation quality as well
as generalizes well to unseen test sets.
