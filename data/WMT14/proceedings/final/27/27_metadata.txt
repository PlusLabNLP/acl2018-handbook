Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our English-Hindi and Hindi-English statistical
systems submitted to the WMT14 shared task. The core components of our
translation systems are phrase based (Hindi-English) and factored
(English-Hindi) SMT systems. We show that the use of number, case and Tree
Adjoining Grammar information as factors helps to improve English-Hindi
translation, primarily by generating morphological inflections correctly. We
show improvements to the translation systems using pre-procesing and
post-processing components. To overcome the structural divergence between
English and Hindi, we preorder the source side sentence to conform to the
target language word order. Since parallel corpus is limited, many words are
not translated. We translate out-of-vocabulary words and transliterate named
entities in a post-processing stage. We also investigate ranking of
translations from multiple systems to select the best translation.
