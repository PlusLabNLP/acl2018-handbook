Abstract#==#This paper presents the machine translation systems submitted by the Abu-MaTran
project to the WMT 2014 translation task. The language pair concerned is
English-French with a focus on French as the target language. The French to
English translation direction is also considered, based on the word alignment
computed in the other direction. Large language and translation models are
built using all the datasets provided by the shared task organisers, as well as
the monolingual data from LDC. To build the translation models, we apply a
two-step data selection method based on bilingual cross-entropy difference and
vocabulary saturation, considering each parallel corpus individually. Synthetic
translation rules are extracted from the development sets and used to train
another translation model. We then interpolate the translation models,
minimising the perplexity on the development sets, to obtain our final SMT
system. Our submission for the English to French translation task was ranked
second amongst nine teams and a total of twenty submissions.
