Abstract#==#We use referential translation machines (RTM) for quality estimation of
translation outputs.
RTMs are a computational model for identifying the
translation acts between any two data sets with respect to interpretants
selected in the same
domain,
which are effective when making bilingual and monolingual similarity judgments.
RTMs achieve top performance in automatic, accurate, and language independent
prediction of
sentence-level and word-level statistical machine translation (SMT) quality.
RTMs remove the need to access any SMT system specific information or prior
knowledge of the
training data or models used when generating the translations and achieve the
top performance in
WMT13 quality
estimation task (QET13).
We improve our RTM models with the Parallel FDA5 instance selection model, with
additional features for predicting the translation performance, and with
improved learning models.
We develop RTM models for each WMT14 QET (QET14) subtask, obtain improvements
over QET13 results,
and rank $1$st in all of the tasks and subtasks of QET14.
