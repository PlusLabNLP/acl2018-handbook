Abstract#==#This paper presents the results of the WMT14 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the outputs of the MT systems involved in
WMT14 Shared Translation Task. We collected scores of 23 metrics from 12
research groups. In addition to that we computed scores of 4 standard metrics
such as BLEU, WER, PER as baselines. The collected scores were evaluated in
terms of system level correlation (how well each metric's scores correlate with
WMT14 official manual ranking of systems) and in terms of segment level
correlation (how often a metric agrees with humans in comparing two
translations of a particular sentence).
