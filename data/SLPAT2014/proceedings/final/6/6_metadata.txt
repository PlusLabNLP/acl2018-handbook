Abstract#==#The requirements of user interface for dyslexics have not been yet properly
explored. Accessibility to any kind of information or just to entertainment web
pages is a key factor to equality of rights, moreover it breaks down social
barriers. Considering that study materials are nowadays very much accessible
through internet, by accommodating web content to anyhow disabled users must be
seen as natural thing. Dyslexia is considered as an cognitive impairment
arising from visual similarity of letters, therefore we focus on Czech language
which uses special characters. The aim of our research is to introduce an
application that allows dyslexics to decode text easier and understand it
properly.
