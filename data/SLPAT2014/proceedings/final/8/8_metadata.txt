Abstract#==#We aim to build dialogue agents that optimize the dialogue strategy,
specifically through learning the dialogue model components from dialogue data.
In this paper, we describe our                          current research on
automatically
learning
dialogue strategies in the healthcare domain. We go through our systematic
approach of learning dialogue model components from data, specifically user
intents and the user model,  as well as the agent reward function.  We
demonstrate our experiments on healthcare data from which we learned the
dialogue model components. We conclude by describing our current research for
automatically learning dialogue features that can be used in representing
dialogue states and learning the reward function.
