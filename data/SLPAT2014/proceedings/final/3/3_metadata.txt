Abstract#==#A silent speech interface (SSI) maps articulatory movement data to speech
output. Although still in experimental stages, silent speech interfaces hold
significant potential for facilitating oral communication in persons after
laryngectomy or with other severe voice impairments. Despite the recent efforts
on silent speech recognition algorithm development using offline data analysis,
online test of SSIs have rarely been conducted. In this paper, we present a
preliminary, online test of a real-time, interactive SSI based on
electromagnetic motion tracking. The SSI played back synthesized speech sounds
in response to the userâ€™s tongue and lip movements. Three English talkers
participated in this test, where they mouthed (silently articulated) phrases
using the device to complete a phrase-reading task. Among the three
participants, 96.67% to 100% of the mouthed phrases were correctly recognized
and corresponding synthesized sounds were played after a short delay.
Furthermore, one participant demonstrated the feasibility of using the SSI for
a short conversation. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and
potential of silent speech interfaces based on electromagnetic articulograph
for future clinical applications.
