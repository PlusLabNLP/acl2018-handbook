Abstract#==#Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) policy suffers from a lack of
large scale quantitative evidence on the demographics of users and diversity of
devices.

The 2013 Domesday Dataset was created to aid formation of AAC policy at the
national level. The dataset records  purchases of AAC technology by the UK's
National Health Service between 2006 and 2012; giving information for each item
on: make, model, price, year of purchase, and geographic area of purchase.  The
dataset was designed to help answer open questions about the provision of AAC
services in the UK; and the level of detail of the dataset is such that it can
be used at the research level to provide context for researchers and to help
validate (or not) assumptions about everyday AAC use. 

This paper examine three different ways of using the Domesday Dataset to
provide verified evidence to support, or refute, assumptions, uncover important
research problems, and to properly map the technological distinctiveness of a
user community.
