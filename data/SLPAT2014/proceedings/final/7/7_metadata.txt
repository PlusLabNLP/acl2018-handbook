Abstract#==#To help individuals with Alzheimer's disease live at home for longer, we are
developing a mobile robotic platform, called ED, intended to be used as a
personal caregiver to help with the performance of activities of daily living.
In a series of experiments, we study speech-based interactions between each of
10 older adults with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and ED as the former makes tea in a
simulated home environment. Analysis reveals that speech recognition remains a
challenge for this recording environment, with word-level accuracies between
5.8% and 19.2% during household tasks with individuals with Alzheimer's
disease. This work provides a baseline assessment for the types of technical
and communicative challenges that will need to be overcome in human-robot
interaction for this population.
