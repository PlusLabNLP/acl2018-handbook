Abstract#==#We present our submission to the Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for
Language Education (STAPLE) challenge.
We used a standard Transformer model for translation, with a crosslingual
classifier predicting correct translations on the output n-best list.
To increase the diversity of the outputs, we used additional data to train the
translation model, and
we trained a paraphrasing model based on the Levenshtein Transformer
architecture to generate further synonymous translations.
The paraphrasing results were again filtered using our classifier.
While the use of additional data and our classifier filter were able to improve
results, the paraphrasing model produced too many invalid outputs to
further improve the output quality.
Our model without the paraphrasing component finished in the middle of the
field for the shared task, improving over the best baseline by a margin of
10-22 % weighted F1 absolute.
