Abstract#==#Generative training of energy-based models has recently achieved promising results in image modeling tasks. Their success is due to efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling. However, gradient-based inference has not yet successfully applied to high-dimensional discrete tasks such as machine translation. Nevertheless, we can still benefit from the power of energy-based models to improve the performance of autoregressive neural machine translation (NMT). Building on \citeauthor{grover&al19}~(\citeyear{grover&al19}) and \citeauthor{deng&al20}~(\citeyear{deng&al20}) we introduce energy-reweighted NMT (ERNMT) as a joint model combining an autoregressive NMT and an energy-based model that is trained to discriminate samples of the autoregressive NMT from the data distribution. The energy model re-weighs the samples from the autoregressive model such that the joint model is a better fit for the data distribution. 
The energy model is defined over the sentences of the target language; thus it can be shared among all language pairs that have a common target language to create a multi-source ERNMT. Our multi-source ERNMT consistently outperforms Transformer-based autoregressive NMT on several translation tasks. In particular, it improves the Sinhala-English translation task by +3 BLEU points.
