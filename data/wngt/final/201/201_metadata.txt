Abstract#==#Recent studies  have  shown  that  translation quality of NMT systems can be improved by providing document-level contextual information.   In  general  sentence-based  NMT  models  are  extended  to  capture  contextual  information  from  large-scale  document-level  corpora  which  are  difficult  to  acquire.   Domain adaptation  on  the  other  hand  promises  adapting components of already developed systems by  exploiting  limited  in-domain  data.    This paper presents FJWUâ€™s system submission at WNGT, we specifically participated in Document level MT task for German-English translation.  Our system is based on context-aware Transformer model developed on top of original NMT architecture by integrating contextual information using attention networks. Our experimental results show providing previous sentences as context significantly improves the BLEU  score  as  compared  to  a  strong  NMT baseline.   We  also  studied  the  impact  of  domain adaptation on document level translationand were able to improve results by adaptingthe systems according to the testing domain.
