Abstract#==#We present approaches for the identification of sentences understandable by
second language learners of Swedish, which can be used in automatically
generated exercises based on corpora. In this work we merged methods and
knowledge from machine learning-based readability research, from rule-based
studies of Good Dictionary Examples and from second language learning
syllabuses. The proposed selection methods have also been implemented as a
module in a free web-based language learning platform. Users can use different
parameters and linguistic filters to personalize their sentence search with or
without a machine learning component assessing readability. The sentences
selected have already found practical use as multiple-choice exercise items
within the same platform. Out of a number of deep linguistic indicators
explored, we found mainly lexical-morphological and semantic features
informative for second language sentence-level readability. We obtained a
readability classification accuracy result of 71\%, which approaches the
performance of other models used in similar tasks. Furthermore, during an
empirical evaluation with teachers and students, about seven out of ten
sentences selected were considered understandable, the rule-based approach
slightly outperforming the method incorporating the machine learning model.
