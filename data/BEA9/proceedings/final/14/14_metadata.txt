Abstract#==#We describe a system for automatically scoring a vocabulary item type that asks
test-takers to use two specific words in writing a sentence based on a picture.
 The system consists of a rule-based component and a machine learned
statistical model which uses a variety of construct-relevant features. 
Specifically, in constructing the statistical model, we investigate if grammar,
usage, and mechanics features developed for scoring essays can be applied to
short answers, as in our task.                                We also explore new
features
reflecting
the
quality of the collocations  in the response, as well as features measuring the
consistency of the response to the picture. System accuracy in scoring is 15
percentage points greater than the majority class baseline and 10 percentage
points less than human performance.
