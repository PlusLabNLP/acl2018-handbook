Abstract#==#Automatically generating challenging distractors for multiple-choice gap-fill
items is still an unsolved problem. We propose to employ context-sensitive
lexical inference rules in order to generate distractors that are semantically
similar to the gap target word in some sense, but not in the particular sense
induced by the gap-fill context. We hypothesize that such distractors should be
particularly hard to distinguish from the correct answer. We focus on verbs as
they are especially difficult to master for language learners and find that our
approach is quite effective. In our test set of 20 items, our proposed method
decreases the number of invalid distractors in 90% of the cases, and fully
eliminates all of them in 65%. Further analysis on that dataset does not
support our hypothesis regarding item difficulty as measured by average error
rate of language learners. We conjecture that this may be due to limitations in
our evaluation setting, which we plan to address in future work.
