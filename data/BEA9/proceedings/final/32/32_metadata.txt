Abstract#==#Automated assessment of student learning has become the subject of increasing
attention. Students’ textual responses to short answer questions offer a rich
source of data for assessment. However, automatically analyzing textual
constructed responses poses significant computational challenges, exacerbated
by the disfluencies that occur prominently in elementary students’ writing.
With robust text analytics, there is the potential to analyze a student’s
text re-sponses and accurately predict his or her future success.  In this
paper, we propose applying soft cardinality, a technique that has shown success
grading less disfluent student answers, on a corpus of fourth-grade responses
to constructed response questions. Based on decomposition of words into their
constituent character substrings, soft cardinality’s evaluations of responses
written by fourth graders correlates with summative analyses of their content
knowledge.
