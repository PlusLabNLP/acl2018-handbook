Abstract#==#This work introduces new methods for detecting non-scorable tests, i.e., tests
that cannot be accurately scored automatically, in educational applications of
spoken language proficiency assessment. Those include cases of unreliable
automatic speech recognition (ASR), often because of noisy, off-topic, foreign
or unintelligible speech. We examine features that estimate signal-derived
syllable information and compare it with ASR results in order to detect
responses with problematic recognition. Further, we explore the usefulness of
language model based features, both for language models that are highly
constrained to the spoken task, and for task independent phoneme language
models. We validate our methods on a challenging dataset of young English
language learners (ELLs) interacting with an automatic spoken assessment
system. Our proposed methods achieve comparable performance compared to
existing non-scorable detection approaches, and lead to a 21\% relative
performance increase when combined with existing approaches.
