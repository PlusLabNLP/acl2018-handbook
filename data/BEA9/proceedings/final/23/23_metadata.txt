Abstract#==#The paper investigates the problem of sentence readability assessment, which is
modelled as a classification task, with a specific view to text semplification.
In particular, it aims at addressing two open issues connected with it, 
i.e. the corpora to be used for training, and the identification of the most
effective features to determine sentence readability. An existing readability
assessment tool developed for Italian was specialized at the level of the
training corpus and of the learning algorithm. A maximum entropy--based feature
selection and ranking algorithm (grafting) was used to identify to the most
relevant features: it turned out that assessing the readability of sentences is
a complex task, requiring a high number of features, mainly syntactic ones.
