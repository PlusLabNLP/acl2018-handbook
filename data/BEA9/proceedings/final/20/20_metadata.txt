Abstract#==#This paper describes an end-to-end prototype system for automated scoring of
spoken responses in a novel assessment for teachers of English as a Foreign
Language who are not native speakers of English. The 21 speaking items
contained in the assessment elicit both restricted and moderately restricted
responses, and their aim is to assess the essential speaking skills that
English teachers need in order to be effective communicators in their
classrooms.  Our system consists of a state-of-the-art automatic speech
recognizer; multiple feature generation modules addressing diverse aspects of
speaking proficiency, such as fluency, pronunciation, prosody, grammatical
accuracy, and content accuracy; a filter that identifies and flags problematic
responses; and linear regression models that predict response scores based on
subsets of the features. The automated speech scoring system was trained and
evaluated on a data set involving about 1,400 test takers, and achieved a
speaker-level correlation (when scores for all 21 responses of a speaker are
aggregated) with human expert scores of 0.73.
