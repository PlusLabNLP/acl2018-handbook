Abstract#==#This paper presents a proof-of-concept tool for providing automated explicit
feedback to language learners based on data mined from Wikipedia revisions. The
tool takes a sentence with a grammatical error as input and displays a ranked
list of corrections for that error along with evidence to support each
correction choice. We use lexical and part-of-speech contexts, as well as query
expansion with a thesaurus to automatically match the error with evidence from
the Wikipedia revisions. We demonstrate that the tool works well for the task
of preposition selection errors, evaluating against a publicly available
corpus.
