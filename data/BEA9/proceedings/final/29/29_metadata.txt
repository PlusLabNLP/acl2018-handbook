Abstract#==#Writers usually need iterations of revisions and edits during their writings.
To better understand the process of rewriting, we need to know what has changed
between the revisions. Prior work mainly focuses on detecting corrections
within sentences, which is at the level of words or phrases. This paper
proposes to detect revision changes at the sentence level. Looking at revisions
at a higher level allows us to have a different understanding of the revision
process. This paper also proposes an approach to automatically detect sentence
revision changes. The proposed approach shows high accuracy in an evaluation
using first and final draft essays from an undergraduate writing class.
