Abstract#==#The paper offers an effective way of teacher-student computer-based
collaboration in translation class. We show how a quantitative-qualitative
method of analysis supported by word alignment technology can be applied to
student translations for use in the classroom. The combined use of
natural-language processing and manual techniques enables students to
‘co-emerge’ during highly motivated collaborative sessions. Within the
advocated approach, students are pro-active seekers for a better translation
(grade) in a teacher-centered computer-based peer-assisted translation class.
