Abstract#==#Discussion forums serve as a platform for student discussions in massive open
online courses (MOOCs). Analyzing content in these forums can uncover useful
information for improving student retention and help in initiating instructor
intervention. In this work, we explore the use of topic models, particularly
seeded topic models toward this goal. We demonstrate that features derived from
topic analysis help in predicting student survival.
