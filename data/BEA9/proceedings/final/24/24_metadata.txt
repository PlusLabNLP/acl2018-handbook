Abstract#==#Recent research aims to automatically predict whether peer feedback is of high
quality, e.g.  suggests solutions to identified problems. While prior studies
have focused on peer review of papers, similar issues arise when reviewing
diagrams and other artifacts. In addition, previous studies have not carefully
examined how the level of prediction granularity impacts both accuracy and
educational utility. In this paper we develop models for predicting the quality
of peer feedback regarding argument diagrams. We propose to perform prediction
at the sentence level, even though the educational task is to label feedback at
a multi-sentential comment level. We first introduce a corpus annotated at a
sentence level granularity, then build comment prediction models using this
corpus. Our results show that  aggregating sentence prediction outputs to label
comments not only outperforms approaches that directly train on comment
annotations, but also provides useful information for enhancing peer review
systems with new functionality.
