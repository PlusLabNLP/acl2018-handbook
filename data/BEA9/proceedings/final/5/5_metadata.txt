Abstract#==#This paper describes the design and rationale behind a classification scheme
for English margin comments. The scheme's design was informed by pragmatics and
pedagogy theory, and by observations made from a corpus of 24,387 margin
comments from assessed university assignments. The purpose of the scheme is to
computationally explore content and form relationships between margin comments
and the passages to which they point. The process of designing the scheme
resulted in the conclusion that margin comments require more work to understand
than utterances do, and that they are more prone to being misunderstood.
