Abstract#==#We investigate data driven natural lan-
guage generation under the constraints
that all words must come from a fixed vo-
cabulary and a specified word must ap-
pear in the generated sentence, motivated
by the possibility for automatic genera-
tion of language education exercises. We
present fast and accurate approximations
to the ideal rejection samplers for these
constraints and compare various sentence
level generative language models. Our
best systems produce output that is with
high frequency both novel and error free,
which we validate with human and auto-
matic evaluations.
