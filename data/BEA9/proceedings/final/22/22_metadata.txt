Abstract#==#Modern automated essay scoring systems rely on identifying
linguistically-relevant features to estimate essay quality. This paper attempts
to bridge work in psycholinguistics and natural language processing by
proposing sentence processing complexity as a feature for automated essay
scoring, in the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). To quantify
processing complexity we used a psycholinguistic model called surprisal theory.
First, we investigated whether essays' average surprisal values decrease with
EFL training. Preliminary results seem to support this idea. Second, we
investigated whether surprisal can be effective as a predictor of essay
quality. The results indicate an inverse correlation between surprisal and
essay scores. Overall, the results are promising and warrant further
investigation on the usability of surprisal for essay scoring.
