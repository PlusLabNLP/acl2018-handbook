Abstract#==#We present a low-resource, language-independent system for text difficulty
assessment. We replicate and improve upon a baseline by Shen et al. (2013) for
readability assessment on the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale. Our
work demonstrates that the addition of morphological, information theoretic,
and language modeling features to a traditional readability baseline greatly
benefits performance on this scale. We compare two algorithms, the
Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm and Support Vector Machines, for our
experiments on Arabic, Dari, English, and Pashto and provide a detailed
analysis of our results.
