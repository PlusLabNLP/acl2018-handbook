Abstract#==#This paper addresses the task of automatically detecting plagiarized responses
in the context of a test of spoken English proficiency for non-native speakers.
 A corpus of spoken responses containing plagiarized content was collected from
responses to a high-stakes assessment of English proficiency for non-native
speakers, and several text-to-text similarity metrics were implemented to
compare these responses to a set of materials that were identified as likely
sources for the plagiarized content.  Finally, a classifier was trained using
these similarity metrics to predict whether a given spoken response is
plagiarized or not.  The classifier was evaluated on a data set containing the
responses with plagiarized content and non-plagiarized control responses and
achieved accuracies of 92.0% using transcriptions and 87.1% using ASR output
(with a baseline accuracy of 50.0%).
