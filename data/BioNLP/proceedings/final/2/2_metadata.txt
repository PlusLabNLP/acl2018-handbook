Abstract#==#We apply semi-supervised topic modeling techniques to detect health-related
discussions in everyday telephone conversations, which has applications in
large-scale epi- demiological studies and for clinical in- terventions for
older adults. The privacy requirements associated with utilizing everyday
telephone conversations preclude manual annotations; hence, we explore
semi-supervised methods in this task. We adopt a semi-supervised version of
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to guide the learning process. Within this
framework, we investigate a strategy to discard irrel- evant words in the topic
distribution and demonstrate that this strategy improves the average F-score on
the in-domain task and an out-of-domain task (Fisher corpus). Our results show
that the increase in dis- cussion of health related conversations is
statistically associated with actual medi- cal events obtained through weekly
self-reports.
