Abstract#==#Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are trans-mittable between animals and humans,
represent emerging or re-emerging pathogens that pose significant public health
threats throughout the world. It is therefore crucial to advance current
surveillance mechanisms for these viruses through outlets such as
phylogeography. Phylogeographic techniques may be applied to trace the origins
and geographical distribution of these viruses using sequence and location
data, which are often obtained from publicly available databases such as
GenBank. Despite the abundance of zoonotic viral sequence data in GenBank
records, phylogeographic analysis of these viruses is greatly limited by the
lack of adequate geographic metadata. Although more detailed information may
often be found in the related articles referenced in these records, manual
extraction of this information presents a severe bottleneck. In this work, we
propose an automated system for extracting this information using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) methods. In order to validate the need for such a
system, we first determine the percentage of GenBank records with
“insufficient” geographic metadata for seven well-studied zoonotic viruses.
We then evaluate four different named entity recognition (NER) systems which
may help in the automatic extraction of information from related articles that
can be used to improve the GenBank geographic metadata. This includes a novel
dictionary-based location tagging system that we introduce in this paper.
