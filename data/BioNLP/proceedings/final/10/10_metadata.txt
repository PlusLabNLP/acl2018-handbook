Abstract#==#The continuously increasing number of publications within the biomedical domain
has fuelled the creation of literature based discovery (LBD) systems which
identify unconnected pieces of knowledge appearing in separate literatures
which can be combined to make new discoveries. Without filtering, the amount of
hidden knowledge found is vast due to noise, making it impractical for a
researcher to examine, or clinically evaluate, the potential discoveries. We
present a number of filtering techniques, including two which exploit the LBD
system itself rather than being based on a statistical or manual examination of
document collections, and we demonstrate usefulness via replication of known
discoveries.
