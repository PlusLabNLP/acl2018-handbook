Abstract#==#One of the most important features of
health care is to be able to follow a
progress over time and identify events in
a temporal order. We describe initial steps
in creating resources for automatic temporal
reasoning of Swedish medical text.
As a first step, we focus on the identification
of temporal expressions, by exploiting
existing resources and systems available
for English. We adapt the HeidelTime
system and manually evaluate its performance
on a small subset of Swedish intensive
care unit documents. On this subset,
the adapted version of HeidelTime
achieves a precision of 92% and a recall
of 66%. We also extract the most frequent
temporal expressions from a separate,
larger subset, and note that most expressions
concern parts of days or specific
times. We intend to further develop resources
for temporal reasoning of Swedish
medical text by creating a gold standard
also annotated with events and temporal
links, in addition to temporal expressions
and their normalised values.
