Abstract#==#The dual process model (Evans, 2008) posits two types of decision-making, which
may be ordered on a continuum from intuitive to analytical (Hammond, 1981).
This work uses a dataset of narrated image-based clinical reasoning, collected
from physicians as they diagnosed dermatological cases presented as images. Two
annotators with training in cognitive psychology assigned each narrative a
rating on a four-point decision scale, from intuitive to analytical. This work
discusses the annotation study, and makes contributions for resource creation
methodology and analysis in the clinical domain.
