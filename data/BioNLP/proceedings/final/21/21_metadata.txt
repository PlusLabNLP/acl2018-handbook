Abstract#==#An up-to-date problem list is useful for assessing a patientâ€™s current
clinical status. Natural language processing can help maintain an accurate
problem list. For instance, a patient problem list from a clinical document can
be derived from individual problem mentions within the clinical document once
these mentions are mapped to a standard vocabulary. In order to develop and
evaluate accurate document-level inference engines for this task, a patient
problem list could be generated using a standard vocabulary. Adequate coverage
by standard vocabularies is important for supporting a clear representation of
the patient problem concepts described in the texts and for interoperability
between clinical systems within and outside the care facilities. In this pilot
study, we report the reliability
of domain expert generation of a patient problem list from a variety of
clinical texts and evaluate the coverage of annotated patient problems against
SNOMED CT and SNOMED Clinical Observation Recording and Encoding (CORE) Problem
List. Across report types, we learned that patient problems can be annotated
with agreement ranging from 77.1% to 89.6% F1-score and mapped to the CORE with
moderate coverage ranging from 45%-67% of patient problems.
