Abstract#==#While machine learning methods for named entity recognition (mention-level
detection) have become common, ma-chine learning methods have rarely been
applied to normalization (concept-level identification). Recent research
introduced a machine learning method for normalization based on pairwise
learning to rank. This method, DNorm, uses a linear model to score the
similarity between mentions and concept names, and has several desirable
properties, including learning term variation directly from training data. In
this manuscript we employ a dimensionality reduction technique based on
low-rank matrix approximation, similar to latent semantic indexing. We compare
the performance of the low rank method to previous work, using disease name
normalization in the NCBI Disease Corpus as the test case, and demonstrate
increased performance as the matrix rank increases. We further demonstrate a
significant reduction in the number of parameters to be learned and discuss the
implications of this result in the context of algorithm scalability.
