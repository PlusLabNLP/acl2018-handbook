Abstract#==#The vast array of medical text data represents a valuable resource that can be
analyzed to advance the state of the art in medicine. Currently, text mining
methods are being used to analyze medical research and clinical text data. Some
of the main challenges in text analysis are high dimensionality and noisy data.
There is a need to develop novel feature transformation methods that help
reduce the dimensionality of data and improve the performance of machine
learning algorithms. In this paper we present a feature transformation method
named FFTM. We illustrate the efficacy of our method using local term
weighting, global term weighting, and Fuzzy clustering methods and show that
the quality of text analysis in medical text documents can be improved. We
compare FFTM with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by using two different
datasets and statistical tests show that FFTM outperforms LDA.
