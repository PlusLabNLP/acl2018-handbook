Abstract#==#Agrammatic aphasia is a serious language impairment which can occur after a
stroke or traumatic brain injury. We present an automatic method for analyzing
aphasic speech using surface level parse features and context-free grammar
production rules. Examining these features individually, we show that we can
uncover many of the same characteristics of agrammatic language that have been
reported in studies using manual analysis. When taken together, these parse
features can be used to train a classifier to accurately predict whether or not
an individual has aphasia. Furthermore, we find that the parse features can
lead to higher classification accuracies than traditional measures of syntactic
complexity. Finally, we find that a minimal amount of pre-processing can lead
to better results than using either the raw data or highly processed data.
