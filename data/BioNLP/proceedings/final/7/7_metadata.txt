Abstract#==#We present an active learning method for placing the event mentions in an
operative note into a pre-specified event structure.  Event mentions are first
classified into action, peripheral action, observation, and report events.  The
actions are further classified into their appropriate location within the event
structure.  We examine how utilizing active learning significantly reduces the
time needed to completely annotate a corpus of 2,820 appendectomy notes.
