Abstract#==#Free text notes typed by primary care physicians during patient consultations
typically contain highly non-canonical language. Shallow syntactic analysis of
free text notes can help to reveal valuable information for the study of
disease and treatment. We present an exploratory study into chunking such text
using off-the-shelf language processing tools and pre-trained statistical
models. We evaluate chunking accuracy with respect to part-of-speech tagging
quality, choice of chunk representation, and breadth of context features. Our
results indicate that narrow context feature windows give the best results, but
that chunk representation and minor differences in tagging quality do not have
a significant impact on chunking accuracy.
