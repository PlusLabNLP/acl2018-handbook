Abstract#==#This paper presents a method for decomposing long, complex consumer health
questions.  Our approach largely decomposes questions using their syntactic
structure, recognizing independent questions embedded in clauses, as well as
coordinations and exemplifying phrases.  Additionally, we identify elements
specific to disease-related consumer health questions, such as the focus
disease and background information.  To achieve this, our approach combines
rank-and-filter machine learning methods with rule-based methods.  Our results
demonstrate significant improvements over the heuristic methods typically
employed for question decomposition that rely only on the syntactic parse tree.
