Abstract#==#FDA drug package inserts provide comprehensive and authoritative information
about drugs. DailyMed database is a repository of structured product labels
extracted from these package inserts. Most salient information about drugs
remains in free text portions of these labels. Extracting information from
these portions can improve the safety and quality of drug prescription. In this
paper, we present a study that focuses on resolution of coreferential
information from drug labels contained in DailyMed. We generalized and expanded
an existing rule-based coreference resolution module for this purpose.
Enhancements include resolution of set/instance anaphora, recognition of
appositive constructions and wider use of UMLS semantic knowledge. We obtained
an improvement of 40% over the baseline with unweighted average F1-measure
using B-CUBED, MUC, and CEAF metrics. The results underscore the importance of
set/instance anaphora and appositive constructions in this type of text and
point out the shortcomings in coreference annotation in the dataset.
