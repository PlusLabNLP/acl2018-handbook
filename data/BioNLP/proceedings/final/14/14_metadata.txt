Abstract#==#In this paper, we present preliminary results obtained using a system based on
co-occurrence of drug-effect pairs as a first step in the study of detecting
adverse drug reactions and drug indications from social media texts. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that extracts this kind of relationships from user messages that were
collected from an online Spanish health-forum. 
In addition, we also describe the automatic construction of the first Spanish
database for drug indications and adverse drug reactions.
