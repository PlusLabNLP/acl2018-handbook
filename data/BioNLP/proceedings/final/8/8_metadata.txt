Abstract#==#This work focuses on signs and symptoms recognition in biomedical texts
abstracts. This task is linked to named entity recognition but has been little
studied. First, this specific task is described from a linguistic point of
view. Then a methodology combining pattern mining and language processing is
proposed. In the absence of an authoritative annotated corpus, our approach has
the advantage of being weakly-supervised. Preliminary experimental results are
discussed and reveal promising avenues.
