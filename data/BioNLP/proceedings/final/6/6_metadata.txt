Abstract#==#Medical coding is a process of classifying health records according to standard
code sets representing procedures and diagnoses. It is an integral part of
health care in the U.S., and the high costs it incurs have prompted adoption of
natural language processing techniques for automatic generation of these codes
from the clinical narrative contained in electronic health records. The need
for effective auto-coding methods becomes even greater with the impending
adoption of ICD-10, a code inventory of greater complexity than the currently
used code sets. This paper presents a system that predicts ICD-10 procedure
codes from the clinical narrative using several levels of abstraction. First,
partial hierarchical classification is used to identify potentially relevant
concepts and codes. Then, for each of these concepts we estimate the confidence
that it appears in a procedure code for that document. Finally, confidence
values for the candidate codes are estimated using features derived from
concept confidence scores. The concept models can be trained on data with ICD-9
codes to supplement sparse ICD-10 training resources. Evaluation on held-out
data shows promising results.
