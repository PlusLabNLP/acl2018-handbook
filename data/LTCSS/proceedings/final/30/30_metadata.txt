Abstract#==#Party brands are central to theories of Congressional action.  While previous
work assumes that a party's brand---its long run reputation---is a direct
consequence of the content of legislation, in this presentation I show how
partisans from both parties use public statements to craft their own party's
reputation and to undermine their opponents party.   The incentive to craft and
destroy brands varies across legislators, creating systematic distortions in
who contributes to partisan branding efforts, what is said about a party's
brand, and when partisan criticism becomes salient. To demonstrate the
construction of party brands I use new collections of newsletters from
Congressional offices, along with press releases, floor speeches, and media
broadcasts.  Across the diverse sources, I show that ideologically extreme
legislators are the most likely to explain their party's work in Washington and
the most likely to criticize the opposing party---particularly when their is an
opposing party president.  Extreme legislators also engage in more vitriolic
criticism of the opposing party, particularly when opposing presidents are
unpopular.  The result is that parties in rhetoric appear even more combative
and polarized in public debate outside Congress than inside Congress.
