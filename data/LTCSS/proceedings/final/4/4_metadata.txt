Abstract#==#We provide a method for automatically detecting change in language across time
through a chronologically trained neural language model. We train the model on
the Google Books Ngram corpus to obtain word vector representations specific
to each year, and identify words that have changed significantly from 1900 to
2009. The model identifies words such as "cell" and "gay" as having changed
during that time period. The model simultaneously identifies the specific years
during which such words underwent change.
