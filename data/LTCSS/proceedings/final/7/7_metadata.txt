Abstract#==#We report ongoing work that is aiming to develop a data-driven approach to text
analysis for computational social science. The novel feature is the use of a
grammar induction algorithm to identify salient information structures from an
unannotated text corpus. The structures provide richer representations of text
content than keywords, by capturing patterning related to what is written about
key terms. Here we show how information structures were induced from texts that
record political negotiations, and how the structures were used in analyzing
relations between countries and negotiation positions.
