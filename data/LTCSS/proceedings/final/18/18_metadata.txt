Abstract#==#In this paper we introduce the task of fact checking, i.e. the assessment of
the truthfulness of a claim.
 The task is commonly performed manually by journalists verifying the claims
made by public figures. 
Furthermore, ordinary citizens need to assess the truthfulness of the
increasing volume of statements they consume. Thus, developing fact checking
systems is likely to be of use to various members of
society. We first define the task and detail the construction of a publicly
available dataset using statements fact-checked by journalists available
online. Then, we discuss baseline approaches for the task and the challenges
that need to be addressed. Finally, we discuss how fact checking relates to
mainstream natural language processing tasks and can stimulate further
research.
