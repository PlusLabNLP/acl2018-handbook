Abstract#==#We describe a research activity carried out during January--April 2014, seeking
to increase engagement between the natural language processing research
community and scholars of communication and the social sciences.  In this
activity, participants were offered a corpus of text relevant to the 2007--8
financial crisis and an open-ended prompt.  Their responses took the form of a
short paper and an optional demonstration, to which a panel of judges will
respond with the goal of identifying efforts with the greatest potential for
future interdisciplinary collaboration.
