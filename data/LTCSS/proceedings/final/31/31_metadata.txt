Abstract#==#Louis Armstrong (is said to have) said, ``I don't need words --- it's
all in the phrasing''.                    As someone who does natural-language
processing
for a living, I'm a big fan of words; but lately, my collaborators and
I have been studying aspects of phrasing (in the linguistic, rather
than musical sense) that go beyond just the selection of one
particular word over another.  I'll describe some of these projects in
this talk. The issues we'll consider include: Does the way in which
something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it is
remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context? Can
we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their arguments,
in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g., ``pro-choice''
vs. ``pro-life'')?  The settings we'll explore range from movie quotes
that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter,
and the arXiv; to framing in public discourse on the inclusion of
genetically-modified organisms in food.
