Abstract#==#Disaster response agencies incorporate social media as a source of
fast-breaking information to understand the needs of people affected by the
many crises that occur around the world. These agencies look for tweets from
within the region affected by the crisis to get the latest updates on the
status of the affected region. However only 1% of all tweets are "geotagged"
with explicit location information. In this work we seek to identify
non-geotagged tweets that originate from within the crisis region. Towards
this, we address three questions: (1) is there a difference between the
language of tweets originating within a crisis region, (2)  what linguistic
patterns differentiate within-region and outside-region tweets, and (3) can we
automatically identify those originating within the crisis region in real-time?
