Abstract#==#Seeking information online can be an exercise in time wasted wading through
repetitive, verbose text with little actual content. Some documents are more
densely populated with factoids (fact-like claims) than others. The densest
documents are potentially the most efficient use of time, likely to include the
most information. Thus some measure of "factiness" might be useful to readers.
Based on crowdsourced ratings of the factual content of 772 online news
articles, we find that after controlling for widely varying document length
using Heaps' Law, a significant positive correlation exists between perceived
factual content and relative information entropy.
