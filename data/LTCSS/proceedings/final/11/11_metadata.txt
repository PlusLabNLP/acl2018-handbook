Abstract#==#We present an encompassing research endeavour on the public accountability of
new modes of governance in Europe. The aim of this project is to measure the
salience, tonality and framing of regulatory bodies and public interest
organisations in newspaper coverage and parliamentary debates over the last 15
years.
In order to achieve this, we use language technology which is still underused
in political science text analyses. Institutionally, the project has emerged
from a collaboration between a computational linguistics and a political
science department.
