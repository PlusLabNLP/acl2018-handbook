Abstract#==#In this paper, we investigate how topic dynamics
during the course of an interaction
correlate with the power differences between
its participants. We perform this
study on the US presidential debates and
show that a candidateâ€™s power, modeled
after their poll scores, affects how often
he/she attempts to shift topics and whether
he/she succeeds. We ensure the validity
of topic shifts by confirming, through a
simple but effective method, that the turns
that shift topics provide substantive topical
content to the interaction.
