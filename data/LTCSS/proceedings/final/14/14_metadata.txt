Abstract#==#Information from news articles can be used to study correlations between
textual discourse and socioeconomic patterns. This work focuses on the task of
understanding how words contained in the news as well as the news outlets
themselves may relate to a set of indicators, such as economic sentiment or
unemployment rates. The bilinear nature of the applied regression model
facilitates learning jointly word and outlet importance, supervised by these
indicators. By evaluating the predictive ability of the extracted features, we
can also assess their relevance to the target socioeconomic phenomena.
Therefore, our approach can be formulated as a potential NLP tool, particularly
suitable to the computational social science community, as it can be used to
interpret connections between vast amounts of textual content and measurable
society-driven factors.
