Abstract#==#We propose a semi-automatic approach for content analysis that leverages
machine learning (ML) being initially trained on a small set of hand-coded data
to perform a first pass in coding, and then have human annotators correct
machine annotations in order to produce more examples to retrain the existing
model incrementally for better performance. In this “active learning”
approach, it is equally important to optimize the creation of the initial ML
model given less training data so that the model is able to capture most if not
all positive examples, and filter out as many negative examples as possible for
human annotators to correct. This paper reports our attempt to optimize the
initial ML model through feature exploration in a complex content analysis
project that uses a multidimensional coding scheme, and contains codes with
sparse positive examples. While different codes respond optimally to different
combinations of features, we show that it is possible to create an optimal
initial ML model using only a single combination of features for codes with at
least 100 positive examples in the gold standard corpus.
