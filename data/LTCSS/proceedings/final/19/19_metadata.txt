Abstract#==#Selectional preferences, the tendencies of
predicates to select for certain semantic
classes of arguments, have been successfully
applied to a number of tasks in computational
linguistics including word sense disambiguation,
semantic role labeling, relation extraction,
and textual inference. Here we leverage
the information encoded in selectional preferences
to the task of predicting fine-grained
categories of authors on the social media platform
Twitter. First person uses of verbs that
select for a given social role as subject 
(e.g. "I teach ..." for teacher) are used to 
quickly build up binary classifiers for that role.
