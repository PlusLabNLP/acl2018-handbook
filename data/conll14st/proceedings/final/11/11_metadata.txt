Abstract#==#This paper describes the system of Shanghai Jiao Tong Unvierity team in the
CoNLL-2014 shared task.
The task focuses on the correction of grammatical errors and all of 28 types of
errors are required to be corrected.
In our approach, the detection of grammatical errors is regarded as multi-label
classification.
Then errors are corrected by applying a rule-based approach based on the
labels. 
A single maximum entropy classifier is introduced to do the classification that
it integrates everything in one model and can detect all labels of words
simultaneously. 
Our system achieved precision of 29.83, recall of 5.16 and F\_0.5 of 15.24 in
the official evaluation.
