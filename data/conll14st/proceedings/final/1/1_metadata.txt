Abstract#==#In this paper we describe the PKU system for the CoNLL-2014 grammar error
correction shared task. We propose a unified framework for correcting all types
of errors. A language model is used to correct the replacement errors while two
extra classification models are trained to correct errors related to
determiners and prepositions. Our system achieves 24.19% in f_0.5 on the test
data.
