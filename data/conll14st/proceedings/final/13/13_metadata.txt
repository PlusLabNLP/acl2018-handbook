Abstract#==#The CoNLL-2014 shared task was devoted to grammatical error correction of all
error types. In this paper, we give the task definition, present the data sets,
and describe the evaluation metric and scorer used in the shared task. We also
give an overview of the various approaches adopted by the participating teams,
and present the evaluation results. Compared to the CoNLL-2013 shared task, we
have introduced the following changes in CoNLL-2014: (1) A participating system
is expected to detect and correct grammatical errors of all types, instead of
just the five error types in CoNLL-2013; (2) The evaluation metric was changed
from F1 to F0.5, to emphasize precision over recall; and (3) We have two human
annotators who independently annotated the test essays, compared to just one
human annotator in CoNLL-2013.
