Abstract#==#The CoNLL-2014 shared task is an extension of last year's shared task and
focuses on correcting grammatical errors in essays written by non-native
learners of English.  In this paper, we describe the Illinois-Columbia system
that participated in the shared task. The core of the system is based on the
University of Illinois model that placed first in the CoNLL-2013 shared task.
This baseline model has been improved and expanded for this year's competition
in several respects. We describe our underlying approach, which relates to our
previous work, and describe the novel aspects of the system in more
detail.
