Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose two enhancements to a statistical machine translation
based approach to grammar correction for correcting all error categories.
First, we propose tuning the SMT systems to optimize a metric more suited to
the grammar correction task F-Î² rather than the traditional BLEU metric used
for tuning language translation tasks. While the results do not indicate
improvement due to tuning with the new metric, we believe this could be due to
the small number of grammatical errors in the tuning corpus and further
investigation is required to answer the question conclusively. We also explore
the combination of custom-engineered grammar correction techniques, which are
targeted to specific error categories, with the SMT based method. Our simple
ensemble methods yield improvements in recall but decrease the precision.
Tuning the custom-built techniques can help in increasing the overall accuracy
also.
