Abstract#==#The paper describes the POSTECH grammatical error correction system. Various
methods are proposed to correct errors such as rule-based, probability n-gram
vector approaches and router-based approach. Google N-gram count corpus is
mainly used for correction resource. Correction candidates are extracted from
NUCLE training data and each candidate is evaluated in development data to
extract high precision rules and n-gram frames. We achieved an overall F0.5
score of 30.26%.
