Abstract#==#This paper describes our factored statistical machine translation (SMT) system
for grammatical error correction by using small-scale training data in the
CoNLL 2014 Shared Task. We constructed several systems with various factors
compared with phrase-based statistical machine translation. The factors contain
not only morphological information such as stem, prefix, suffix, but also
syntactic information such as PoS. We tried to easily combine different systems
or use the pipeline, although the effects are not so good, it exposed a lot of
valuable information.
