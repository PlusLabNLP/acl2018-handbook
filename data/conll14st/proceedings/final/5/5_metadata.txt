Abstract#==#Statistical machine translation toolkits like Moses have not been 
designed with grammatical error correction in mind. In order to achieve 
competitive results in this area, it is not enough to simply add more data. 
Optimization procedures need to be customized, task-specific features should be
introduced. Only then can the decoder take advantage of relevant data.

We demonstrate the validity of the above claims by combining web-scale language
models and large-scale error-corrected texts with parameter tuning according to
the task metric and correction-specific features. Our system achieves a result 
of 34.0\% F$_{1}$ on the blind CoNLL-2014 test. A similar system equipped with 
identical models, but without tuned parameters and specialized features,
stagnates 
at 24.2\%.
