Abstract#==#Sarcasm is a type of figurative language broadly adopted in social media and daily conversations. The sarcasm can ultimately alter the meaning of the sentence, which makes
the opinion analysis process error-prone. In this paper, we propose to employ bidirectional
encoder representations transformers (BERT), and aspect-based sentiment analysis
approaches in order to extract the relation between context dialogue sequence and response
and determine whether or not the response is sarcastic. The best performing method of ours
obtains an F1 score of 0.73 on the Twitter dataset and 0.734 over the Reddit dataset at the second workshop on figurative language processing Shared Task 2020.
