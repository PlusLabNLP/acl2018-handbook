Abstract#==#Detecting sarcasm and verbal irony is critical for  understanding  people's  actual  sentiments and beliefs. Thus, the field of sarcasm analysis has become a popular research problem in natural language processing.  As the community working on computational approaches for sarcasm detection is growing, it is imperative to conduct benchmarking studies to analyze the current state-of-the-art, facilitating progress in this area.  We report on the shared task on sarcasm detection we conducted as a part of the 2nd  Workshop  on  Figurative  Language  Processing (FigLang 2020) at ACL 2020.
