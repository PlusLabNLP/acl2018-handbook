Abstract#==#Under the framework of the argumentation scheme theory (Walton, 1996), we
developed annotation protocols for an argumentative writing task to support
identification and classification of the arguments being made in essays. Each
annotation protocol defined argumentation schemes (i.e., reasoning patterns) in
a given writing prompt and listed questions to help evaluate an argument based
on these schemes, to make the argument structure in a text explicit and
classifiable. We report findings based on an annotation of 600 essays. Most
annotation categories were applied reliably by human annotators, and some
categories significantly contributed to essay score. An NLP system to identify
sentences containing scheme-relevant critical questions was developed based on
the human annotations.
