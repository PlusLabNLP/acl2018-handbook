Abstract#==#Subject of the paper is a new methodological approach for the analysis of
public discourses aiming at the semi-automated identification of arguments. Up
to now, only little research deals with the automation of manual
discourse-linguistic argumentation analysis in German corpora. Therefore, we
suggest the combination of methods from discourse analysis with methods from
Natural Language Processing such as multi-level annotation. The presented
approach is intended to be a first at-tempt to argumentation mining.
