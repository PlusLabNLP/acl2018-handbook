Abstract#==#The ability to analyze the adequacy of supporting information is necessary for
determining the strength of an argument. This is especially the case for online
user comments, which often consist of arguments lacking proper substantiation
and reasoning. Thus, we develop a framework for automatically classifying each
proposition as UNVERIFIABLE, VERIFIABLE NONEXPERIENTIAL, or VERIFIABLE
EXPERIENTIAL, where the appropriate type of support is reason, evidence, and
optional evidence, respectively. Once the existing support for propositions are
identified, this classification can provide an estimate of how adequately the
arguments have been supported. We build a gold standard dataset of 9,476
sentences and clauses from 1,047 comments submitted to an eRulemaking platform
and find that
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained with n-grams and additional
features capturing the verifiability and experientiality exhibit statistically
significant improvement over the unigram baseline, achieving a macro-averaged
F1 of 68.99%.
