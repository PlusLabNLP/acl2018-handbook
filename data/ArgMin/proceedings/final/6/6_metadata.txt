Abstract#==#Automated argumentation mining requires an adequate type system or annotation
scheme for classifying the patterns of argument that succeed or fail in a
corpus of legal documents. Moreover, there must be a reliable and accurate
method for classifying the arguments found in natural language legal documents.
Without an adequate and operational type system, we are unlikely to reach
consensus on argument corpora that can function as a gold standard. This paper
reports the preliminary results of research to annotate a sample of
representative judicial decisions for the reasoning of the factfinder. The
decisions report whether the evidence adduced by the petitioner adequately
supports the claim that a medical theory causally links some type of vaccine
with various types of injuries or adverse medical conditions. This paper
summarizes and discusses some patterns of reasoning that we are finding, using
examples from the corpus. The pattern types and examples presented here
demonstrate the difficulty of developing a type or annotation system for
characterizing the logically important patterns of reasoning.
