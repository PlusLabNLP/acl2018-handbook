Abstract#==#Despite recent advances in discourse parsing and causality detection, the
automatic recognition of argumentation structure of authentic texts is still a
very challenging task. To approach this problem, we collected a small corpus of
German microtexts in a text generation experiment, resulting in texts that are
authentic but of controlled linguistic and rhetoric complexity. We show that
trained annotators can determine the argumentation structure on these
microtexts reliably. We experiment with different machine learning approaches
for automatic argumentation structure recognition on various levels of
granularity of the scheme. Given the complex nature of such a discourse
understanding tasks, the first results presented here are promising, but invite
for further investigation.
