Abstract#==#In this paper, we first develop the linguistic characteristics of requirements
which are specific forms of arguments. 
The discourse structures that further refine or elaborate requirements are also
analyzed.
These specific discourse relations are conceptually characterized, with the
functions they play. 
An implementation is carried out in Dislog on the TextCoop platform. Dislog
allows high level specifications in logic that
allow fast and easy prototyping at a high level of linguistic adequacy.
Elements of an indicative evaluation are provided.
