Abstract#==#In the experimental sciences authors use the scientific article to express
their findings by making an argumentative claim.  While past studies have
located the claim in the Abstract, the Introduction, and in the Discussion
section, in this paper we focus on the article title as a potential source of
the claim. Our investigation has suggested that titles which contain a tensed
verb almost certainly announce the argument claim while titles which do not
contain a tensed verb have varied announcements. Another observation that we
have confirmed in our dataset is that the frequency of verbs in titles of
experimental research articles has increased over time.
