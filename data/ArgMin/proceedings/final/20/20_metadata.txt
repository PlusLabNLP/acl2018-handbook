Abstract#==#Argument mining of online interactions is in its infancy. One reason is the
lack of annotated corpora in this genre. To make progress, we need to develop a
principled and scalable way of determining which portions of texts are
argumentative and what is the nature of argumentation. We propose a two-tiered
approach to achieve this goal and report on several initial studies to assess
its potential.
