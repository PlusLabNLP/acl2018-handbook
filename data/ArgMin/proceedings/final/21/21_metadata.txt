Abstract#==#In online discussions, users often back up their stance with arguments. Their
arguments are often vague, implicit, and poorly worded, yet they provide
valuable insights into reasons underpinning users’ opinions. In this paper,
we make a first step towards argument-based opinion mining from on-line
discussions and introduce a new task of argument recognition. We match
user-created comments to a set of predefined topic-based arguments, which can
be either attacked or supported in the comment. We present a manually-annotated
corpus for argument recognition in online discussions. We describe a supervised
model based on comment-argument similarity and entailment features. Depending
on problem formulation, model performance ranges from 70.5% to 81.8% F1-score,
and decreases only marginally when applied to an unseen topic.
