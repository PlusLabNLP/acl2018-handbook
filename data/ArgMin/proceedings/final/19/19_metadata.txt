Abstract#==#Wikipedia contains millions of articles, collaboratively produced. If an
article is controversial, an online “Article for Deletion”(AfD) discussion
is held to determine whether the article should be deleted. It is open to any
user to participate and make a comment or argue an opinion. Some of these
comments and arguments can be counter-arguments, attacks in Dung’s (1995)
argumentation terminology. Here, we consider the extraction of one type of
attack, the directive speech act formed as an imperative.
