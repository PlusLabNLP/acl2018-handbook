Abstract#==#Argumentation in a scientific article is composed of unexpressed and explicit
statements of old and new knowledge combined into a logically coherent textual
argument. Discourse relations, linguistic coherence relations that connect
discourse segments, help to communicate an argument's logical steps. A
biomedical relation exhibits a relationship between biomedical entities. In
this paper, we are primarily concerned with the extraction of  connections
between biomedical relations, a connection that we call a higher order
relation. We combine two methods, namely biomedical relation extraction and
discourse relation parsing, to extract such higher order relations from
biomedical research articles. Finding and extracting these relations can assist
in automatically understanding the scientific arguments expressed by the author
in the text.
