Abstract#==#Essays are frequently used as a medium for teaching and evaluating
argumentation skills.  Recently, there has been interest in diagrammatic
outlining as a replacement to the written outline that often precedes essay
writing.  This paper presents a preliminary approach for automatically
identifying diagram ontology elements in essays, and demonstrates its positive
correlation with expert scores of essay quality.
