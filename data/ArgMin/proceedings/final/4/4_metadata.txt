Abstract#==#Argumentation mining involves automatically identifying the premises,
conclusion, and type of each argument as well as relationships between pairs of
arguments in a document. We describe our plan to create a corpus from the
biomedical genetics research literature, annotated to support argumentation
mining research. We discuss the argumentation elements to be annotated,
theoretical challenges, and practical issues in creating such a corpus.
