Abstract#==#Argumentation mining, a relatively new area of discourse analysis, involves
automatically identifying and structuring arguments. Following a basic
introduction to argumentation, we describe a new possible domain for
argumentation mining: debates in open online collaboration communities. Based
on our experience with manual annotation of arguments in debates, we envision
argumentation mining as the basis for three kinds of support tools, for
authoring more persuasive arguments, finding weaknesses in others’ arguments,
and summarizing a debate’s overall conclusions.
