Abstract#==#The rhetorical classification of sentences in biomedical texts is an important
task in the recognition of the components of a scientific argument. Generating
supervised machine learned models to do this recognition requires corpora
annotated for the rhetorical categories Introduction (or Background), Method,
Result, Discussion (or Conclusion). Currently, a few, small annotated corpora
exist. We use a straightforward feature of co-referring text using the word
"this" to build a self-annotating corpus extracted from a large biomedical
research paper dataset. The corpus is annotated for all of the rhetorical
categories except Introduction without involving domain experts. In a 10-fold
cross-validation, we report an overall F-score of 97% with Naive Bayes and
98.7% with SVM, far above those previously reported.
