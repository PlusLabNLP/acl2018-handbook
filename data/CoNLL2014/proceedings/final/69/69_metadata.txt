Abstract#==#Most state-of-the-art approaches for named-entity recognition (NER)
  use semi supervised information in the form of word clusters and
  lexicons. Recently neural network-based language models have been
  explored, as they as a byproduct generate highly informative vector
  representations for words, known as word embeddings. In this paper
  we present two contributions: a new form of learning word embeddings
  that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve the
  representations, and the first system to use neural word embeddings
  to achieve state-of-the-art results on named-entity recognition in
  both CoNLL and Ontonotes NER. Our system achieves an F1 score of
  90.90 on the test set for CoNLL 2003---significantly better than any
  previous system trained on public data, and matching a system
  employing massive private industrial query-log data.
