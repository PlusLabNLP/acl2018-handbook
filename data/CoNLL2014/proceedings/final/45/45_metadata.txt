Abstract#==#Most previous work in information extraction from text has focused on
named-entity recognition, entity linking, and relation extraction. Less
attention has been paid given to extracting the temporal scope for relations
between named entities; for example, the relation president-Of(John F. Kennedy,
USA) is true only in the time-frame (January 20, 1961 - November 22, 1963). In
this paper we present a system for temporal scoping of relational facts, which
is trained on distant supervision based on the largest semi-structured resource
available: Wikipedia. The system employs language models consisting of patterns
automatically bootstrapped from Wikipedia sentences that contain the main
entity of a page and slot-fillers extracted from the corresponding infoboxes.
This proposed system achieves state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 7 relations
on the benchmark Text Analysis Conference 2013 dataset for temporal slot
filling (TSF), and outperforms the next best system in the TAC 2013 evaluation
by more than 10 points.
