Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of converting Dialectal Arabic (DA) text
that is written in the Latin script (called Arabizi) into Arabic script
following the CODA convention for DA orthography. The presented system uses a
finite state transducer trained at the character level to generate all possible
transliterations for the input Arabizi words. We then filter the generated list
using a DA morphological analyzer. After that we pick the best choice for each
input word using a language model. We achieve an accuracy of 69.4% on an unseen
test set compared to 63.1% using a system which represents a previously
proposed approach.
