Abstract#==#Open IE methods extract structured propositions from text. However, these
propositions are neither consolidated nor generalized, and querying them may
lead to insufficient or redundant information. This work suggests an approach
to organize open IE propositions using entailment graphs. The entailment
relation unifies equivalent propositions and induces a specific-to-general
structure. We create a large dataset of gold-standard proposition entailment
graphs, and provide a novel algorithm for automatically constructing them. Our
analysis shows that predicate entailment is extremely context-sensitive, and
that current lexical-semantic resources do not capture the lexical inferences
induced by proposition entailment.
