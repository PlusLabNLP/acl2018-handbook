Abstract#==#We present a model for generating path-valued interpretations of natural
language text. Our model describes a map from natural language descriptions to
paths, mediated by segmentation variables which break the language into a
discrete set of events, and alignment variables which reorder those events.
Within an event, lexical weights capture the contribution of each word to the
aligned path segment. We demonstrate the applicability of our model on three
diverse tasks: a new color description task, a new financial news task and an
established direction-following task. On all three, the model outperforms
strong baselines, and on a hard variant of the direction-following task it
achieves results close to the state-of-the-art system described in Vogel and
Jurafsky (2010).
