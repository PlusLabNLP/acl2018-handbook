Abstract#==#Cross-lingual learning has become a popular approach to facilitate the
development of resources and tools for low density languages. Its underlying
idea is to make use of existing tools and annotations in resource-rich
languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor languages.
Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel
corpora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a
target language.  In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine
translation to create synthetic training data from the original source-side
annotations.  Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing,
using a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation. Our approach
draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy source-side
annotation of an unrelated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual
treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which
makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers.  We show that this
approach significantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing.
