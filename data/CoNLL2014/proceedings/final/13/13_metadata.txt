Abstract#==#Bootstrapped pattern learning for entity extraction usually starts with seed
entities and iteratively learns patterns and entities from unlabeled text.
Patterns are scored by their ability to extract more positive entities and less
negative entities. A problem is that due to the lack of labeled data, unlabeled
entities are either assumed to be negative or are ignored by the existing
pattern scoring measures. In this paper, we improve pattern scoring by
predicting the labels of unlabeled entities. We  use various unsupervised
features based on contrasting domain-specific and general text, and exploiting
distributional similarity and edit distances to learned entities. Our system
outperforms existing pattern scoring algorithms for extracting
drug-and-treatment entities from four medical forums.
