Abstract#==#Most traditional distributional similarity models fail to capture syntagmatic
patterns that group together multiple word features within the same joint
context.
In this work we introduce a novel generic distributional similarity
scheme under which the power of probabilistic models can be leveraged to
effectively model joint contexts. Based on this scheme, we implement a concrete
model which utilizes probabilistic n-gram language models. 
Our evaluations suggest that this model is particularly well-suited for
measuring similarity for verbs, which are known to exhibit richer syntagmatic
patterns, while maintaining comparable or better performance with respect to
competitive baselines for nouns. Following this, we propose our scheme as a
framework for future semantic similarity models leveraging the substantial body
of work that exists in probabilistic language modeling.
