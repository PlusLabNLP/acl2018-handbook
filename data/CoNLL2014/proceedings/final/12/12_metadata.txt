Abstract#==#We present a Bayesian formulation for weakly-supervised learning of a
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertagger with an HMM. We assume
supervision in the form of a tag dictionary, and our prior encourages the use
of cross-linguistically common category structures as well as transitions
between tags that can combine locally according to CCGâ€™s combinators. Our
prior is theoretically appealing since it is motivated by language-independent,
universal properties of the CCG formalism. Empirically, we show that it yields
substantial improvements over previous work that used similar biases to
initialize an EM-based learner. Additional gains are obtained by further
shaping the prior with corpus-specific information that is extracted
automatically from raw text and a tag dictionary.
