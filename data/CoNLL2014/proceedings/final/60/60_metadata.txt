Abstract#==#In NLP, we need to document that our proposed methods perform {\em
significantly}~better with respect to standard metrics than previous
approaches, typically by reporting $p$-values obtained by rank- or
randomization-based tests. We show that significance results following current
research standards are unreliable and, in addition, very sensitive to sample
size, covariates such as sentence length, as well as to the existence of
multiple metrics. We estimate that under the assumption of perfect metrics and
unbiased data, we need a significance cut-off at ~0.0025 to reduce the risk of
false positive results to <5%. Since in practice we often have considerable
selection bias and poor metrics, this, however, will not do alone.
