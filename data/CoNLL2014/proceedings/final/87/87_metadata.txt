Abstract#==#Phrase-based translation models usually memorize local translation literally
and make independent assumption between phrases which makes it neither
generalize well on unseen data nor model sentence-level effects between
phrases. In this paper we present a new method to model correlations between
phrases into a Markov model and meanwhile employ a robust smoothing strategy to
provide better generalization. It defines a recursive estimation process and
backs off in parallel to infer richer structures.
Our evaluation shows an 1.1--3.2 BLEU improvement over competitive baselines
for Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation.
