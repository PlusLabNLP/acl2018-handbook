Abstract#==#The task of detecting and generating hyponyms is at the core of semantic
understanding of language, and has numerous practical applications.
We investigate how neural network embeddings perform on this task, compared to
dependency-based vector space models, and evaluate a range of similarity
measures on hyponym generation. 
A new asymmetric similarity measure and a combination approach are described,
both of which significantly improve precision. We release three new datasets of
lexical vector representations trained on the BNC and our evaluation dataset
for hyponym generation.
