Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the impact of relational and syntactic representations
for an interesting and challenging task: the automatic resolution of crossword
puzzles. Automatic solvers are typically based on two answer retrieval modules:
(i) a web search engine, e.g., Google, Bing, etc. and (ii) a database (DB)
system for accessing previously resolved crossword puzzles. We show that
learning to rank models based on relational syntactic structures defined
between the clues and the answer can improve both modules above. In particular,
our approach accesses the DB using a search engine and reranks its output by
modeling paraphrasing. This improves on the MRR of previous system up to 53% in
ranking answer candidates and greatly impacts on the resolution accuracy of
crossword puzzles up to 15%.
