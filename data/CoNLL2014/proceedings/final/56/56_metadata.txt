Abstract#==#We present a data-driven framework for image caption generation which
incorporates visual and textual features with varying degrees of spatial
structure. We propose the task of domain-specific image captioning, where many
relevant visual details cannot be captured by off-the-shelf general-domain
entity detectors. We extract previously-written descriptions from a database
and adapt them to new query images, using a joint visual and textual
bag-of-words model to determine the correctness of individual words. We
implement our model using a large, unlabeled dataset of womenâ€™s shoes images
and natural language descriptions (Berg et al., 2010). Using both automatic and
human evaluations, we show that our captioning method effectively deletes
inaccurate words from extracted captions while maintaining a high level of
detail in the generated output.
