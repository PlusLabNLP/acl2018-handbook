Abstract#==#Infants spontaneously discover the relevant phonemes of their language
without any direct supervision. This acquisition is puzzling because it seems
to require the availability of high levels of linguistic structures (lexicon,
semantics), that logically suppose the infants having a set of phonemes
already. We show how this circularity can be broken by testing, in real-size
language corpora, a scenario whereby infants would learn approximate
representations at all levels, and then refine them in a mutual constraining
way. We start with corpora of spontaneous speech that have been encoded in a
varying number of detailed context-dependent allophones. We derive an
approximate lexicon and a rudimentary semantic representation. Despite the fact
that all these representations are poor approximations of the ground truth,
they help reorganize the fine grained categories into phoneme-like categories
with a high degree of accuracy.
