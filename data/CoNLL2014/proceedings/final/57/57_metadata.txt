Abstract#==#We demonstrate that "hallucinating" phrasal translations can significantly
improve the quality of machine translation in low resource conditions. Our
hallucinated phrase tables consist of entries composed from multiple unigram
translations drawn from the baseline phrase table and from translations that
are induced from monolingual corpora. The hallucinated phrase table is very
noisy. Its translations are low precision but high recall. We counter this by
introducing 30 new feature functions (including a variety of
monolingually-estimated features) and by aggressively pruning the phrase table.
Our analysis evaluates the intrinsic quality of our hallucinated phrase pairs
as well as their impact in end-to-end Spanish-English and Hindi-English MT.
