Abstract#==#The resurgence of effort within computational semantics has led to increased
interest in various types of relation extraction and semantic parsing. While
various manually annotated resources exist for enabling this work, these
materials have been developed with different standards and goals in
mind. In an effort to provide better general understanding across these
resources, we provide a summary overview of the standards underlying ACE, ERE,
TAC-KBP Slot-filling, and FrameNet.
