Abstract#==#The Stanford Dependencies are a deep syntactic representation that are widely
used for semantic tasks, like Recognizing Textual Entailment. But do they
capture all of the semantic information a meaning representation ought to
convey? This paper explores this question by investigating the feasibility of 
mapping Stanford dependency parses to Hobbsian Logical Form, a practical,
event-theoretic semantic representation, using only a set of deterministic
rules. Although we find that such a mapping is possible in a large number of
cases, we also find cases for which such a mapping seems to require information
beyond what the Stanford Dependencies encode. These cases shed light on the
kinds of semantic information that are and are not present in the Stanford
Dependencies.
