Abstract#==#This paper describes a system for inter-annotator agreement
analysis of ERE annotation, focusing on entity mentions and how 
the higher-order annotations such as  events are dependent
on those entity mentions.  The goal of this approach is
to provide both (1) quantitative scores for the various levels
of annotation, and (2) information about the 
 types of annotation inconsistencies that might exist.
While primarily designed for inter-annotator agreement, it can
also be considered a system for evaluation of ERE annotation.
