Abstract#==#The goal of this study is to create guidelines for annotating cause-effect
relations as part of the Richer Event Description schema. We present the
challenges faced using the definition of causation in terms of counterfactual
dependence and propose new guidelines for cause-effect annotation using an
alternative definition which treats causation as an intrinsic relation between
events. To support the use of such an intrinsic definition, we examine the
theoretical problems that the counterfactual definition faces, show how the
intrinsic definition solves those problems, and explain how the intrinsic
definition adheres to psychological reality, at least for our annotation
purposes, better than the counterfactual definition. We then evaluate the new
guidelines by presenting results obtained from pilot annotations of ten
documents, showing that an inter-annotator agreement (F1-score) of 0.5753 was
achieved. The results provide a benchmark for future studies concerning
cause-effect annotation in the RED schema.
