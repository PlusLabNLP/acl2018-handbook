Abstract#==#This paper proposes an evaluation scheme to measure the performance of a system
that detects hierarchical event structure for event coreference resolution. We
show that each system output is represented as a forest of unordered trees, and
introduce the notion of conceptual event hierarchy to simplify the evaluation
process. We enumerate the desiderata for a similarity metric to measure the
system performance. We examine three metrics along with the desiderata, and
show that metrics extended from MUC and BLANC are more adequate than a metric
based on Simple Tree Matching.
