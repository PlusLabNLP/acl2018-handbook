Abstract#==#Events are not a discrete linguistic phenomenon.  

Different verbal and nominal predicates express different degrees of
eventiveness.  

In this paper we analyze the qualities that contribute to the overall
eventiveness of a predicate, that is, what makes a predicate an event.               
     

We provide an in-depth analysis of seven key qualities, along with experimental
assessments demonstrating their contributions.                                

We posit that these qualities are an important part of a functional working
definition of events.
