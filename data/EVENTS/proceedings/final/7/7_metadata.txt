Abstract#==#A simple conceptual model is employed to investigate events, and break the task
of coreference resolution into two steps: semantic class detection and
similarity-based matching. With this perspective an algorithm is implemented to
cluster event mentions in a large-scale corpus. Results on test data from
AQUAINT TimeML, which we annotated manually with coreference links, reveal how
semantic conventions vs. information available in the context of event mentions
affect decisions in coreference analysis.
