Abstract#==#Structured machine-readable representations of news articles can radically
change the way we interact with information. One step towards obtaining these
representations is event extraction - the identification of event triggers and
arguments in text. With previous approaches mainly focusing on classifying
events into a small set of predefined types, we analyze unsupervised techniques
for complex event extraction. In addition to extracting event mentions in news
articles, we aim at obtaining a more general representation by disambiguating
to concepts defined in knowledge bases. These concepts are further used as
features in a clustering application. Two evaluation settings highlight the
advantages and shortcomings of the proposed approach.
