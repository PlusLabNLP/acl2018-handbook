Abstract#==#We present a supervised learning method for verbal valency frame detection and
selection, i.e., a specific kind of word sense disambiguation for verbs based
on subcategorization information, which amounts to detecting mentions of events
in text. We use the rich dependency annotation present in the Prague Dependency
Treebanks for Czech and English, taking advantage of several analysis tools
(taggers, parsers) developed on these datasets previously. The frame selection
is based on manually created lexicons accompanying these treebanks, namely on
PDT-Vallex for Czech and EngVallex for English. The results show that verbal
predicate detection is easier for Czech, but in the subsequent frame selection
task, better results have been achieved for English.
