Abstract#==#We investigate past-tense formation preferences for five irregular English verb
classes. We gathered data on a large scale using a nonce probe study
implemented on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We compare a Minimal Generalization
Learner (which infers stochastic rules) with a Generalized Context Model (which
evaluates new items via analogy with existing items) as models of participant
choices. Overall, the GCM is a better predictor, but the the MGL provides some
additional predictive power. Because variation across speakers is greater than
variation across items, we also explore individual-level factors as predictors.
Females exhibited significantly more categorical choices than males, a finding
that can be related to results in sociolinguistics.
