Abstract#==#A problem which arises in the theory of the error-driven ranking model of the
acquisition of phonotactics is that the faith- fulness constraints need to be
promoted but should not be promoted too high. This paper motivates this
technical problem and shows how to tune the promotion component of the
re-ranking rule so as to keep the faithfulness constraints at bay.
