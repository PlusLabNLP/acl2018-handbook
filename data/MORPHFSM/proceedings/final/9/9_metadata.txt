Abstract#==#We present an efficient method to automatically transform spoken language text
to standard written language text for various dialects of Tamil. Our work is
novel in that it explicitly addresses the problem and need for processing
dialectal and spoken language Tamil. Written language equivalents for dialectal
and spoken language forms are obtained using Finite State Transducers (FSTs)
where spoken language suffixes are replaced with appropriate written language
suffixes. Agglutination and compounding in the resultant text is handled using
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) based word boundary identifier. The essential
Sandhi corrections are carried out using a heuristic Sandhi Corrector which
normalizes the segmented words to simpler sensible words. During experimental
evaluations dialectal spoken to written transformer (DSWT) achieved an
encouraging accuracy of over 85% in transformation task and also improved the
translation quality of Tamil-English machine translation system by 40%. It must
be noted that there is no published computational work on processing Tamil
dialects. Ours is the first attempt to study various dialects of Tamil in a
computational point of view. Thus, the nature of the work reported here is
pioneering.
