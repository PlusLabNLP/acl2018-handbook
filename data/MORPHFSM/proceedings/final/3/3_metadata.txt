Abstract#==#Having a morphological analyzer is a very critical issue especially for NLP
related tasks on agglutinative languages. This paper presents a detailed
computational analysis of Kazakh language which is an agglutinative language.
With a detailed analysis of Kazakh language morphology, the formalization of
rules over all morphotactics of Kazakh language is worked out and a rule-based
morphological analyzer is developed for Kazakh language. The morphological
analyzer is constructed using two-level morphology approach with Xerox finite
state tools and some implementation details of rule-based morphological
analyzer have been presented in this paper.
