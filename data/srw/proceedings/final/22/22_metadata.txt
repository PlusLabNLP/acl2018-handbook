Abstract#==#We go beyond the level of individual sentences applying parse tree kernels to
paragraphs. We build a set of extended trees for a paragraph of text from the
individual parse trees for sentences and learn short texts such as search
results and social profile postings to take advantage of additional
discourse-related information. Extension is based on coreferences and rhetoric
structure relations between the phrases in different sentences. We evaluate our
approach, tracking relevance classifi-cation improvement for multi-sentence
search task. The search problem is formulated as classification of search
results into the classes of relevant and irrelevant, learning from the Bing
search results. We compare performances of individual sentence kernels with the
ones for extended parse trees and show that adding discourse information to
learning data helps to improve classification results.
