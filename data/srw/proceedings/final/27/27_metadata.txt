Abstract#==#We present ongoing doctoral work on automatically understanding the
   positions of politicians with respect to those of the party they
   belong to. To this end, we use textual data, namely transcriptions of
   political speeches from meetings of the German Bundestag, and party
   manifestos, in order to automatically acquire the positions of
   political actors and parties, respectively. We discuss a variety of
   possible supervised and unsupervised approaches to determine the
   topics of interest and compare positions, and propose to explore an
   approach based on topic modeling techniques for these tasks.
