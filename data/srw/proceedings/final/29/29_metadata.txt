Abstract#==#This work presents a supervised prepositional phrase (PP) attachment
disambiguation system that uses contextualized distributional information as
the distance metric for a nearest-neighbor classifier.              Contextualized
word vectors constructed from the GigaWord Corpus provide a method for implicit
Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD), whose reliability helps this system outperform
baselines and achieve comparable results to those of systems with full WSD
modules.  This suggests that targeted WSD methods are preferable to ignoring
sense information and also to implementing WSD as an independent module in a
pipeline.
