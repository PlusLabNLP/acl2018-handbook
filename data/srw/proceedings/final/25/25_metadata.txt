Abstract#==#The current work adapts the optimal tree pruning algorithm introduced by
Breiman et al. and extended by Chou et al. to the multi-document summarization
task.  The tree designed by Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm is
successively pruned with the optimal tree pruning algorithm and the sentences
assigned to the leaves of the resultant pruned tree are included in the
summary.
