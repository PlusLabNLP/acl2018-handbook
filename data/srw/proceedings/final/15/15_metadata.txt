Abstract#==#Deep learning embeddings have been successfully used for many natural language
processing problems. Embeddings are mostly computed for word forms although
lots of recent papers have extended this to other linguistic units like
morphemes and word sequences. In this paper, we define the concept of
generalized phrase that includes conventional linguistic phrases as well as
skip-bigrams. We compute embeddings for generalized phrases and show in
experimental evaluations on coreference resolution and paraphrase
identification that such embeddings perform
better than word form embeddings.
