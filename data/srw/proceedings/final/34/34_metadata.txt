Abstract#==#Various models have been developed for normalizing informal text. In this
paper, we propose two methods to improve normalization performance. First is an
unsupervised approach that automatically identifies pairs of a non-standard
token and proper word from a large unlabeled corpus. We use semantic similarity
based on continuous word vector representation, together with other surface
similarity measurement. Second we propose a reranking strategy to combine the
results from different systems. This allows us to incorporate information that
is hard to model in individual systems as well as consider multiple systems to
generate a final rank for a test case. Both word- and sentence-level
optimization schemes are explored in this study. We evaluate our approach on
data sets used in prior studies, and demonstrate that our proposed methods
perform better than the state-of-the-art systems.
