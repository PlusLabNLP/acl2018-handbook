Abstract#==#We consider the problem of mapping natural language written utterances
expressing operational instructions to formal language expressions, applied to
French and the R programming language. Developing a learning operational
assistant requires the means to train and evaluate it, that is, a baseline
system able to interact with the user. After presenting the guidelines of our
work, we propose a model to represent the problem and discuss the fit of direct
mapping methods to our task. Finally, we show that, while not resulting in
excellent scores, a simple approach seems to be sufficient to provide a
baseline for an interactive learning system.
