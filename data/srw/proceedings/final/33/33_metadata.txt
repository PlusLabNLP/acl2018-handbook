Abstract#==#Open Information Extraction (Open IE) serves for the analysis of vast amounts
of texts by extraction of assertions, or relations, in the form of tuples
<argument 1; relation; argument 2>. Various approaches to Open IE have been
designed to perform in a fast, unsupervised manner. All of them require
language specific information for their implementation. In this work, we
introduce an approach to Open IE based on syntactic constraints over POS tag
sequences targeted at Spanish language. We describe the rules specific for
Spanish language constructions and their implementation in ExtrHech, an Open IE
system for Spanish. We also discuss
language-specific issues of implementation. We compare ExtrHech's performance
with that of ReVerb, a similar Open IE system for English, on a parallel
dataset and show that these systems perform at a very similar level. We also
compare ExtrHech's performance on a dataset of grammatically correct sentences
against its performance on a dataset of random texts extracted from the Web,
drastically different in their quality from the first dataset. The latter
experiment shows robustness of ExtrHech on texts from the Web.
