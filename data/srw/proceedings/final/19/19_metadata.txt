Abstract#==#Translation of discourse relations is one of the recent efforts of
incorporating discourse information to statistical machine translation (SMT). 
While existing works focus on disambiguation of ambiguous discourse
connectives, or transformation of discourse trees, only explicit discourse
relations are tackled. A greater challenge exists in machine translation of
Chinese, since implicit discourse relations are abundant and occur both inside
and outside a sentence.   This thesis proposal describes ongoing work on
bilingual discourse annotation and plans  towards incorporating discourse
relation knowledge to an SMT system for Chinese and English with consideration
of implicit discourse relations. The final goal is a discourse-unit-based
translation model that disregards the traditional assumption of
sentence-to-sentence translation.
