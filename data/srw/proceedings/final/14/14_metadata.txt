Abstract#==#Kernel methods are heavily used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Frequentist approaches like Support Vector Machines are the state-of-the-art in
many tasks. However, these approaches lack efficient procedures for model
selection, which hinders the usage of more advanced kernels. In this work, we
propose the use of a Bayesian approach for kernel methods, Gaussian Processes,
which allow easy model fitting even for complex kernel combinations. Our goal
is to employ this approach to improve a number of regression and classification
tasks in NLP.
