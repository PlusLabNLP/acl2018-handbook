Abstract#==#Data-driven approach for parsing may suffer from data sparsity when entirely
unsupervised. External knowledge has been shown to effectively help mitigate
this problem. Subordinating conjunctions impose important constraints on
Chinese syntactic structures. This paper proposes a method to train a grammar
with hierarchical subordinating conjunctions category knowledge as explicit
annotations. Firstly, each part-of-speech tag of the subordinating conjunctions
is annotated with the coarsest category in the hierarchical knowledge. These
categories are human-defined to represent distinct syntactic constraints, and
provide a good starting point for splitting. Secondly, based on the data-driven
state-split approach, we establish a mapping from each automatic refined
subcategory to one subcategory in the hierarchical knowledge. Then the
data-driven splitting of these categories are restricted by the knowledge to
avoid over refinement. Experiments show that constraining the grammar learning
by the hierarchical knowledge improves parsing performance significantly on the
baseline.
