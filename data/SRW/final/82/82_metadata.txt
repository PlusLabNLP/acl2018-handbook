Abstract#==#We present a simple and effective dependency parser for Telugu, a morphologically rich, free word order language.  We propose to replace the  rich  linguistic  feature  templates  used  in the  past  approaches  with  a  minimal  feature function  using  contextual  vector  representations.  We train a BERT model on the Telugu Wikipedia data and use vector representations from this model to train the parser.  Each sentence token is associated with a vector representing  the  token  in  the  context  of  that  sentence and the feature vectors are constructed by  concatenating  two  token  representations from  the  stack  and one from the buffer. We put the feature representations through a feedforward network and train with a greedy transition based approach. The resulting parser has a  very  simple  architecture  with  minimal feature engineering and achieves state-of-the-art results for Telugu.
