Abstract#==#To process the syntactic structures of a language in ways that are
compatible with human expectations, we need computational
representations of lexical and syntactic properties that form the
basis of human knowledge of words and sentences.

Recent neural-network-based and distributed semantics techniques have
developed systems of considerable practical success and impressive
performance. As has been advocated by many, however, such systems
still lack human-like properties. In particular, linguistic,
psycholinguistic and neuroscientific investigations have shown that
human processing of sentences is sensitive to structure and unbounded
relations.

In the spirit of better understanding the structure building and
long-distance properties of neural networks, I will present an
overview of recent results on agreement and island effects in syntax
in several languages. While certain sets of results in the literature
indicate that neural language models exhibit long-distance agreement
abilities, other finer-grained investigation of how these effects are
calculated indicates that that the similarity spaces they define do
not correlate with human experimental results on intervention
similarity in long-distance dependencies. This opens the way to
reflections on how to better match the syntactic properties of natural
languages in the representations of neural models.
