Abstract#==#To accomplish the shared task on dependency parsing we explore the use of a linear
transition-based neural dependency parser as well as a combination of three of them by means of a linear tree combination algorithm. We train separate models for each language
on the shared task data. We compare our base parser with two biaffine parsers and
also present an ensemble combination of all five parsers, which achieves an average UAS
1.88 point lower than the top official submission.
For producing the enhanced dependencies, we exploit a hybrid approach, coupling
an algorithmic graph transformation of the dependency tree with predictions made by a multitask machine learning model.
