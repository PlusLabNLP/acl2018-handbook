Abstract#==#We present new experiments that transfer techniques from {P}robabilistic {C}ontext-free {G}rammars with {L}atent {A}nnotations ({PCFG-LA}) to two grammar formalisms for discontinuous parsing: linear context-free rewriting systems and hybrid grammars. In particular, {D}irichlet priors during {EM} training, ensemble models, and a new nonterminal scheme for hybrid grammars are evaluated. We find that our grammars are more accurate than previous approaches based on discontinuous grammar formalisms and early instances of the discriminative models but inferior to recent discriminative parsers.
