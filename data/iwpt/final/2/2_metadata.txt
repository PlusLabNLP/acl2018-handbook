Abstract#==#We present a neural end-to-end architecture for negation resolution
  based on a formulation of the task as a graph parsing problem.
  Our approach allows for the straightforward inclusion of many types
  of graph-structured features without the need for
  representation-specific heuristics.
  In our experiments, we specifically gauge the usefulness of
  syntactic information for negation resolution.
  Despite the conceptual simplicity of our architecture, we achieve
  state-of-the-art results on the Conan Doyle benchmark dataset,
  including a new top result for our best model.
