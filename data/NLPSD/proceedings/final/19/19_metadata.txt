Abstract#==#People express and amplify political opinions in Microblogs such as Twitter,
especially when major political decisions are made. Twitter provides a useful
vehicle for capturing and tracking popular opinion on burning issues of the
day. In this paper, we focus on tracking the changes in political sentiment
related to the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) and its decisions, focusing on the
key dimensions on support, emotional intensity, and polarity. Measuring changes
in these sentiment dimensions could be useful for social and political
scientists, policy makers, and the public. This preliminary work adapts
existing sentiment analysis techniques to these new dimensions and the
specifics of the corpus (Twitter). We illustrate the promise of our work with
an important case study of tracking sentiment change building up to, and
immediately following one recent landmark Supreme Court decision. This example
illustrates how our work could help answer fundamental research questions in
political science about the nature of Supreme Court power and its capacity to
influence public discourse.
