Abstract#==#In this paper I apply a novel method of network text analysis to a sample of
150 original screenplays. That sample is divided evenly between unproduced,
original screenplays (n = 75) and those that were nominated for Best Original
Screenplay by either the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences or by major
film critics associations (n = 75). As predicted, I find that the text networks
derived from unproduced screenplays are significantly less complex, i.e. they
contain fewer concepts (nodes) and statements (links). Unexpectedly, I find
that those same networks are more cohesive, i.e. they  exhibit higher density
and coreness.
