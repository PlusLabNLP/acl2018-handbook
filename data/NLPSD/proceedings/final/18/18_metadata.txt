Abstract#==#Texts propagate among participants in many social networks and provide evidence
for network structure. We describe intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for
algorithms that detect clusters of reused passages embedded within longer
documents in large collections. We explore applications of these approaches to
two case studies: the culture of free reprinting in the nineteenth-century
United States and the use of similar language in the public statements of U.S.
members of Congress.
