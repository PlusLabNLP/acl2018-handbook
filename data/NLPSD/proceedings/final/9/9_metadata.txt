Abstract#==#Online social communities are becoming increasingly popular platforms for
people to share information, seek emotional support, and maintain
accountability for losing weight. Studying the language and discourse in these
communities can offer insights on how users benefit from using these
applications. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of language and
discourse patterns in forum posts by users who lose weight and keep it off
versus users with fluctuating weight dynamics.              Our results reveal
differences
about how the types of posts, polarity of sentiments, and semantic cohesion of
posts made by users vary along with their weight loss pattern. To our
knowledge, this is the first discourse-level analysis of language and weight
loss dynamics.
