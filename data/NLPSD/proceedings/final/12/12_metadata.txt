Abstract#==#Self-disclosure, the act of revealing oneself to others, is an important social
behavior that contributes positively to intimacy and social support from
others. It is a natural behavior, and social scientists have carried out
numerous quantitative analyses of it through manual tagging and survey
questionnaires. 
Recently, the flood of data from online social networks (OSN) offers a
practical way to observe and analyze self-disclosure behavior at an
unprecedented scale. The challenge with such analysis is that OSN data come
with no annotations, and it would be impossible to manually annotate the data
for a quantitative analysis of self-disclosure. 
As a solution, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach, using a
variant of latent Dirichlet allocation for automatically classifying
self-disclosure in a massive dataset of Twitter conversations. 
For measuring the accuracy of our model, we manually annotate a small subset of
our dataset, and we show that our model shows significantly higher accuracy and
F-measure than various other methods.
With the results our model, we uncover a positive and significant relationship
between self-disclosure and online conversation frequency over time.
