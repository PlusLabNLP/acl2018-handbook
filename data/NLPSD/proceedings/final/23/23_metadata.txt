Abstract#==#Detection of fine-grained opinions and
beliefs holds promise for improved social
media analysis for social science research,
business intelligence, and government
decision-makers. While commercial
applications focus on mapping landscapes
of opinions towards brands and products,
our goal is to map “sociostructural” landscapes
of perceptions of social groups. In
this work, we focus on the detection of
views of social group status differences.
We report an analysis of methods for detecting
views of the legitimacy of income
inequality in the U.S. from online discussions,
and demonstrate detection rates
competitive with results from similar tasks
such as debate stance classification.
