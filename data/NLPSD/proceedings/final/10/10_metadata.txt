Abstract#==#Forums have become major places for online communications for many years, where
people often share and express opinion. We observe that, when editing posts,
people would whether seriously show their opinions or play jokes and write
meaningless post on the discussed topics. We design a unified probabilistic
graphical model to capture both topic-driven words and style-driven words. The
model can help us separate serious and unserious posts and users. An extensive
set of experiments prove the effectiveness of our model.
