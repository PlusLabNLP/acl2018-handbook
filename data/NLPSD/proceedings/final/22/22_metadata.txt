Abstract#==#Twitter has become one of the foremost
platforms for information sharing. Consequently,
it is beneficial for the consumers
of Twitter to know the origin of a tweet,
as it affects how they view and interpret
this information. In this paper, we
classify tweets based on their origin, exploiting
only the textual content of tweets.
Specifically, using a rich, linguistic feature
set and a supervised classifier framework,
we classify tweets into two user
types - organizations and individual persons.
Our user type classifier achieves an
89% F1-score for identifying tweets that
originate from organizations in English
and an 87% F1-score for Spanish. We
also demonstrate that classifying the user
type of a tweet can improve downstream
event recognition tasks. We analyze several
schemes that exploit user type information
to enhance Twitter event recognition
and show that substantial improvements
can be achieved by training separate
models for different user types.
