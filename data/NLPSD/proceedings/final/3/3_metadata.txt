Abstract#==#The article reveals how a lot of foreign nouns adopted in Modern Hebrew,
 and how the users used a special procedure to "squeeze" the foreign word 
and got the consonants only, and used it as a "root" to be introduced in 
certain patterns, thus creatin new words, as exaample from the Eglish 
"compilation" they squeezed a string Q M P L and used it in a pattern:
 -i--e- and got a new Hebrew verb "qimpel" = made compilation of a code.
