Abstract#==#Natural language traffic in social media (blogs, microblogs, talkbacks) enjoys
vast monitoring and analysis efforts. However, the question whether computer
systems can generate such content in order to effectively interact with humans
has been only sparsely attended to. This paper presents an architecture for
generating subjective responses to opinionated articles based on usersâ€™
agendas, documents topics, sentiments and a knowledge graph. We present an
empirical
evaluation method for quantifying the human-likeness and relevance of the
generated responses. We show that responses generated using additional world
knowledge in the input are regarded as more human-like than those that rely on
topic, sentiment and agenda only, whereas the use of world knowledge does not
affect perceived relevance.
