Abstract#==#Social media are increasingly being used
to complement traditional survey methods
in health, politics, and marketing. However,
little has been done to adjust for the
sampling bias inherent in this approach.
Inferring demographic attributes of social
media users is thus a critical step to improving
the validity of such studies. While
there have been a number of supervised
machine learning approaches to this problem,
these rely on a training set of users
annotated with attributes, which can be
difficult to obtain. We instead propose
training a demographic attribute classifiers
that uses county-level supervision.
By pairing geolocated social media with
county demographics, we build a regression
model mapping text to demographics.
We then adopt this model to make predictions
at the user level. Our experiments
using Twitter data show that this approach
is surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised
approach, estimating the race of
a user with 80% accuracy.
