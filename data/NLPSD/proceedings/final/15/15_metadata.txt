Abstract#==#The Hollywood Blacklist was  based on a series of interviews conducted by the
House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), trying to identify members of
the communist party. We use various NLP algorithms in order to automatically 
analyze a large corpus of interview transcripts and construct a network of the 
industry members and their ``naming'' relations. We further use algorithms for 
Sentiment Analysis in order to add a psychological dimension to the edges in
the 
network. In particular, we test how different types of connections are 
manifested by different sentiment types and attitude of the interviewees. 
Analysis of the language used in the hearings can shed new light on 
the motivation and role of network members.
