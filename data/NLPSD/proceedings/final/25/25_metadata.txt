Abstract#==#Do rewards from retailers such as free
products and recognition in the form of
status badges1 influence the recipient’s behavior?
We present a novel application
of natural language processing to detect
differences in consumer behavior due to
such rewards. Specifically, we investigate
the “Enrollment” effect, i.e. whether receiving
products for free affect how consumer
reviews are written. Using data
from Amazon’s Vine program, we conduct
a detailed analysis to detect stylistic
differences in product reviews written
by reviewers before and after enrollment
in the Vine program. Our analysis suggests
that the “Enrollment” effect exists.
Further, we are able to characterize the
effect on syntactic and semantic dimensions.
This work has implications for researchers,
firms and consumer advocates
studying the influence of user-generated
content as these changes in style could potentially
influence consumer decisions.
