Abstract#==#This paper describes lex4all, an open-source PC application for the generation
and evaluation of pronunciation lexicons in any language. With just a few
minutes of recorded audio and no expert knowledge of linguistics or speech
technology, individuals or organizations seeking to create speech-driven
applications in low-resource languages can build lexicons enabling the
recognition of small vocabularies (up to 100 terms, roughly) in the target
language using an existing recognition engine designed for a high-resource
source language (e.g. English). To build such lexicons, we employ an existing
method for cross-language phoneme-mapping. The application also offers a
built-in audio recorder that facilitates data collection, a significantly
faster implementation of the phoneme-mapping technique, and an evaluation
module that expedites research on small-vocabulary speech recognition for
low-resource languages.
