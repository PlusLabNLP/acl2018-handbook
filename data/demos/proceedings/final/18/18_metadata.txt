Abstract#==#Vector space word representations are useful
for many natural language processing
applications. The diversity of techniques
for computing vector representations
and the large number of evaluation
benchmarks makes reliable comparison a
tedious task both for researchers developing
new vector space models and for
those wishing to use them. We present
a website and suite of offline tools that
that facilitate evaluation of word vectors
on standard lexical semantics benchmarks
and permit exchange and archival by users
who wish to find good vectors for their
applications. The system is accessible at:
www.wordvectors.org.
