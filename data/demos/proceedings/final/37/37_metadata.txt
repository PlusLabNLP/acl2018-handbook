Abstract#==#We present a new version of the Google Books Ngram Viewer, which plots the
frequency of words and phrases over the last five centuries; its data
encompasses 6% of the worldâ€™s published books. The new Viewer adds three
features for more powerful search: wildcards, morphological inflections, and
capitalization. These additions allow the discovery of patterns that were
previously difficult to find and further facilitate the study of linguistic
trends in printed text.
