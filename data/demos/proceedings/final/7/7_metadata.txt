Abstract#==#This paper introduces the KyotoEBMT Example-Based Machine Translation
framework. Our system uses a tree-to-tree approach, employing syntactic
dependency analysis for both source and target languages in an attempt to
preserve non-local structure. The effectiveness of our system is maximized with
online example matching and a flexible decoder. Evaluation demonstrates BLEU
scores competitive with state-of-the-art SMT systems such as Moses. The current
implementation is intended to be released as open-source in the near future.
