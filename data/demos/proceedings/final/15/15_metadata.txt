Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a flexible approach to the efficient and exhaustive
manual annotation of text documents. For this purpose, we extend WebAnno (Yimam
et al., 2013) an open-source web-based annotation tool.1 While it was
previously
limited to specific annotation layers, our extension allows adding and
configuring an arbitrary number of layers through a web-based UI. These layers
can be annotated separately or simultaneously, and support most types of
linguistic annotations such as spans, semantic classes, dependency relations,
lexical chains, and morphology. Further, we tightly integrate a generic machine
learning component for automatic annotation suggestions of span annotations. In
two case studies, we show that automatic annotation suggestions, combined with
our split-pane UI concept, significantly reduces annotation time.
