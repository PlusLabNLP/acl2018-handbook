Abstract#==#We introduce a method that extracts keywords in a language with the help of the
other. In our approach, we bridge and fuse conventionally irrelevant word
statistics in languages. The method involves estimating preferences for
keywords w.r.t. domain topics and generating cross-lingual bridges for word
statistics integration. At run-time, we transform parallel articles into word
graphs, build cross-lingual edges, and exploit PageRank with word keyness
information for keyword extraction. We present the system, BiKEA, that applies
the method to keyword analysis. Experiments show that keyword extraction
benefits from PageRank, globally learned keyword preferences, and cross-lingual
word statistics interaction which respects language diversity.
