Abstract#==#Without inspirations, writing may be a frustrating task for most people. In
this study, we designed and implemented WINGS, a Chinese input method extended
on IBus-Pinyin with intelligent writing assistance. In addition to supporting
common Chinese input, WINGS mainly attempts to spark usersâ€™ inspirations by
recommending both word level and sentence level writing suggestions. The main
strategies used by WINGS, including providing syntactically and semantically
related words based on word vector representation and recommending contextually
related sentences based on LDA, are discussed and described. Experimental
results suggest that WINGS can facilitate Chinese writing in an effective and
creative manner.
