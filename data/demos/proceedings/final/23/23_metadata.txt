Abstract#==#More and more product information, including advertisements and user reviews,
are presented to Internet users nowadays. Some of the information is false,
misleading or overstated, which can cause seriousness and needs to be
identified. Authorities, advertisers, website owners and consumers all have the
needs to detect such statements. In this paper, we propose a False
Advertisements Recognition system called FAdR by using one-class and binary
classification models. Illegal advertising lists made public by a government
and product descriptions from a shopping website are obtained for training and
testing. The results show that the binary SVM models can achieve the highest
performance when unigrams with the weighting of log relative frequency ratios
are used as features. Comparatively, the benefit of the one-class
classification models is the adjustable rejection rate parameter, which can be
changed to suit different applications. Verb phrases more likely to introduce
overstated information are obtained by mining the datasets. These phrases help
find problematic wordings in the advertising texts.
