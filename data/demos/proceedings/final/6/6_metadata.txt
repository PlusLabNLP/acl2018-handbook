Abstract#==#Interactive or Incremental Statistical Machine Translation (IMT) aims to
provide a mechanism that allows the statistical models involved in the
translation process to be incrementally updated and improved. The source of
knowledge normally comes from users who either post-edit the entire translation
or just provide the translations for wrongly translated domain-specific
terminologies. The majority of the existing work on IMT uses batch learning
paradigm which does not allow translation system to make use of the new input
instantaneously. We introduce an adaptive MT framework with a Rule Definition
Language (RDL) for users to amend MT results through translation rules or
patterns. Experimental results show that our system acknowledges user feedback
via RDL which improves the translations of the baseline system on three test
sets for Vietnamese to English translation.
