Abstract#==#We present two recently released open-source taggers: NameTag is a free
software for named entity recognition (NER) which achieves state-of-the-art
performance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morphological Dictionary and Tagger) performs
morphological analysis (with lemmatization), morphological generation, tagging
and tokenization with state-of-the-art results for Czech and a throughput
around 10-200K words per second. The taggers can be trained for any language
for which annotated data exist, but they are specifically designed to be
efficient for inflective languages,  Both tools are free software under LGPL
license and are distributed along with trained linguistic models which are free
for non-commercial use under the CC~BY-NC-SA license. The releases include
standalone tools, C++ libraries with Java, Python and Perl bindings and web
services.
