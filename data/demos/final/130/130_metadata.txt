Abstract#==#Natural language   interfaces   to   databases(NLIDB)  democratize  end  user  access  to  relational data.  Due to fundamental differences between natural language communication and programming,  it is common for end users to issue questions that are ambiguous to the system  or  fall  outside  the  semantic  scope  of  its underlying query language.  We present PHOTON, a robust, modular, cross-domain NLIDB that can flag natural language input to which a SQL mapping cannot be immediately determined.   PHOTON consists  of  a  strong  neural semantic parser (63.2% structure accuracy on the  Spider  dev  benchmark),  a  human-in-the-loop question corrector, a SQL executor and a response generator.  The question corrector isa discriminative neural sequence editor which detects confusion span(s) in the input question and suggests rephrasing until a translatable input is given by the user or a maximum number of  iterations  are  conducted.   Experiments  on simulated data show that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of text-to-SQL system against untranslatable user input.The live demo of our system is available at http://www.naturalsql.com
