In this paper, we propose a new unsuper- vised learning framework to use news events for predicting trends in stock prices. We present Word Influencer Networks (WIN), a graph framework to extract longitudinal tem- poral relationships between any pair of infor- mative words from news streams. Using the temporal occurrence of words, WIN measures how the appearance of one word in a news stream influences the emergence of another set of words in the future. The latent word-word influencer relationships in WIN are the build- ing blocks for causal reasoning and predic- tive modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of WIN by using it for unsupervised extraction of latent features for stock price prediction and obtain 2 orders lower prediction error com- pared to a similar causal graph based method. WIN discovered influencer links from seem- ingly unrelated words from topics like poli- tics to finance. WIN also validated 67\% of the causal evidence found manually in the text through a direct edge and the rest 33\% through a path of length 2.
