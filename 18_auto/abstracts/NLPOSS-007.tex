Open-source software packages for language processing often include stop word lists. Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions (e.g. ``hasn't'' but not ``hadn't'') and inclusions (''computer''), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer. Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists, and propose strategies for mitigating these issues.
