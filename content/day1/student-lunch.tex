Join your fellow students for a free students-only networking event, on
\daydate from 6:15pm, straight after the end of the final session of Day
1 of the main conference. The event will be split across two adjoining
venues (Showtime and Common Man), just outside the Melbourne Convention
and Exhibition Centre on the Yarra River.  Soft drinks and canap\'es
will be provided, and there will be a cash bar for those who want to
imbibe. Tickets to the event have been allocated to student registrants
on a first-come-first-served basis, and can be found inside your
conference badge. This is a chance to get to know other students in a
casual atmosphere, and also speak to recruiters about possible future
career paths.
