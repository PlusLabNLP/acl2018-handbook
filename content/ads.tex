Helping a billion people connect requires innovation. At Facebook, we
solve technical problems no one else has seen because no one else has
built a social network of this size. Working at the intersection of
research and engineering to make the world more open and connected is
one of the best things about being at Facebook right
now. \url{https://www.facebook.com/academics/}
