It is an honor to write the initial words of this proceedings as General Chair of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics!  This is only the second time that an ACL conference has been held in Australia --- the first time was for the joint COLING/ACL conference in June of 2006 in Sydney, and I was one of its Program Chairs.  For ACL 2018 we have tried to maintain the welcoming and intimate spirit and the relaxed and genial character of the much smaller ACL conferences of the past in spite of the ever-growing number of researchers in the field and participants in our conferences.

It is my pleasure here to express gratitude to all those without whom this
conference would not exist.  My  biggest  thanks  go  to the Program  Chairs Iryna Gurevych and Yusuke Miyao, as well as to Local Chairs Tim Baldwin, Trevor Cohn and Karin Verspoor.  They have done a tremendous job to manage the 
submission and review process, and the local arrangement details, respectively.

I also want to thank all of the other chairs for their very hard work:  Workshops  Chairs Brendan O'Connor and Eva Maria Vecchi;  Tutorials  Chairs Yoav Artzi
and Jacob Eisenstein; Demo Chairs Fei Liu and Thamar Solorio; Student Research Workshop Organizers Vered Shwartz, Jeniya Tabassum and Rob Voigt;  Faculty
Advisors to the Student Research Workshop Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Wanxiang Che and Malvina Nissim; 
Publications Chairs Shay Cohen, Kevin Gimpel and Wei Lu; Exhibits Coordinator Karin Vespoor; Student Volunteer Coordinator Karin Vespoor; Conference Handbook Chairs Jey Han Lau and Trevor Cohn;
Publicity Chair Sarvnaz Karimi; Local Sponsorship Chair Cecile Paris; 
Webmaster Andrew MacKinlay; and Priscilla Rasmussen, giver of advice and wisdom  to all of us as ACL Business Manager.    

I also warmly thank the ACL Executive Committee for its guidance and advice on many important issues and concerns as they arose.

I am also extremely grateful to all the sponsors for their great support to the conference.

Many thanks to the area chairs, the reviewers, the invited speakers, the authors of the various papers, posters and presentations. 

And, finally, many many 
thanks to all the participants who will put the final touches on 
making ACL 2018 an exciting, stimulating and inspiring event! \\
