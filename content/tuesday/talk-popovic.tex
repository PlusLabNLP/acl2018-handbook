{\bfseries Abstract:} Recent studies show that to achieve mastery of a
topic by 95\% of the student population, some students need ten times
more learning content than is available in current curricula.  At
issue is not just increased volume, but the need for a highly
differentiated content specialized to promote optimal learning for
each unique learner.  To address this synthesis problem we have
developed a generative platform capable of dynamically varying content
based on the individual student needs.  This approach recently
achieved 93\% mastery of a key algebra concept even for primary school
students in three state-wide challenges.  In this talk I will describe
our work on extending the platform to enable students to solve all
word problems in high-school within their preferred context
(e.g. sci-fi, medieval, Harry Potter), as well as to automatically
generate adaptive learning progressions for reading comprehension
curricula in middle school.

{\bfseries Biography:} 
Zoran Popović is the Director of the Center for Game Science at the
University of Washington and the founder of Engaged Learning.  Trained as a
computer scientist, his research focus is on creating interactive engaging
environments for learning and scientific discovery.  His laboratory created
Foldit, a biochemistry game that produced three Nature publications in just
two years, and award-winning math learning games played by over five million
learners worldwide.  He is currently focusing on engaging methods that can
rapidly develop experts in arbitrary domains with particular focus on
revolutionizing K--12 math education.  He has recently founded Engaged
Learning to apply his work on generative adaptation to any curricula towards
the goal of achieving school mastery by 95\% of students.  His contributions
to the field of interactive computer graphics have been recognized by a
number of awards including the NSF CAREER Award, Alfred P.\ Sloan Fellowship
and ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award.
