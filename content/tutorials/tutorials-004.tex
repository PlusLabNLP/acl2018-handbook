Recent advances at the intersection of language and vision have made incredible progress in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering and visual dialog. The challenge now is to extend this progress to embodied agents that move and interact with their visual environments. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the key innovations that have driven progress in language and vision modeling (such as multi-modal pooling, visual and co-attention, dynamic network composition, methods for incorporating external knowledge and cooperative/adversarial games). We will then discuss some of the current and upcoming challenges of combining language, vision, and actions, and discuss some recently-released interactive 3D simulation environments that can be used for this purpose (such as House3D, Home, Minos, Matterport3D Simulator, Gibson, Thor, and Chalet).
