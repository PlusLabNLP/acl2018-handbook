This volume contains the abstracts of the ACL 2018 tutorials. Tutorials 
were selected from 49 submissions to a joint call, which was coordinated 
with NAACL, COLING, and EMNLP. From these submissions, eight half-day 
tutorials were selected for ACL, on the criteria of quality, relevance, 
interest, and balance. We thank Mausam for coordinating this process 
across all four conferences, and we wish to acknowledge support from the 
publications chairs Kevin Gimpel, Shay Cohen, and Wei Lu (ACL 
publications chairs) and Jey Han Lau and Trevor Cohn (ACL handbook 
chairs), as well as Stephanie Lukin (NAACL publications co-chair). Most 
importantly, we thank the tutorial presenters for their contributions, 
which we hope that you will enjoy.
