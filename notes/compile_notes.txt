best way to compile: make; make handbook.ind

during "make", search the following words in the log:
'Error': (reveals dodgy symbols that needs to be corrected)
'Undefined': (reveals undefined macros)
'Missing'

As an example, in NAACL2014 the issues are:
- a number of symbols that need to be manually corrected in 
  auto/abstracts
- there are undefined methods in auto/abstracts
- auto/papers/wednesday-best-paper-session.tex contains an additional // 
  which latex doesn't like
